<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that below, Hal?&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was Chester Crawford, an American lad of some 16
years.</p>

<p>Hal Paine allowed his eyes to turn from the steering wheel and
glanced over the side of the flying aëroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything,&#8221; he replied, after a
careful scrutiny below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I, now,&#8221; said Chester, straining his
eyes.</p>

<p>At this moment the third occupant of the machine made his presence
known.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woof! Woof!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The third speaker was Marquis, a dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woof! Woof!&#8221; he barked again.</p>

<p>Hal, with a quick move, slackened the speed of the aëroplane, and
let it glide gently closer to the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be something wrong,&#8221; he confided to Chester,
&#8220;or Marquis wouldn&#8217;t be barking like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads peered into the darkness that engulfed them on all sides.
As far as the eye could penetrate there was nothing but blackness,
solid, intense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go a little lower, Hal,&#8221; whispered
Chester.</p>

<p>Under Hal&#8217;s firm hand the aëroplane came down gently, until at
last it was soaring close to the treetops. And now, suddenly, both lads
made out the cause of Marquis&#8217;s uneasiness.</p>

<p>Beneath them were thousands upon thousands of armed men. To the
north, to the south, and to the east and west the dense mass of
humanity stretched out. Hal and Chester, flying close to the earth, at
last could make out moving forms below them.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became light. Not broad daylight, but the darkness gave
way enough for the lads to distinguish what lay below them. The dawn of
another day was breaking.</p>

<p>At the same instant that the lads made out the huge mass of humanity
upon the ground their presence in the air was discovered. There came
the sound of a single shot and the whiz of a bullet, as it sped close
to Hal&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>With a quick movement the lad sent the plane soaring high in the air
once more. So sudden was the movement that Chester, caught unprepared,
lost his balance, and saved himself from tumbling to the ground only by
clutching the side of the machine. Marquis also had a narrow escape
from being thrown out. He let out a loud yelp of fear, as he was thrown
violently against Chester. The lad threw out a hand and grabbed him by
the scruff of the neck, just as it seemed he would plunge to certain
destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; he called to Hal, when he finally regained his
breath and his head. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? You
almost dumped us both out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; replied Hal briefly. &#8220;Well, as long as
you didn&#8217;t fall it&#8217;s all right. We had to come up suddenly,
or the chances were we would have gone down suddenly. But it&#8217;s my
fault. I should have given you warning. Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful next time,&#8221; said Hal.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to forgive me this once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no more about it,&#8221; answered Chester. &#8220;But
what was the cause of this sudden rise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cause!&#8221; repeated Hal in astonishment. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t mean to tell me you don&#8217;t know the cause?
Didn&#8217;t you hear that shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard it. But how do you know whether it was fired by
friend or foe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see as that would make any difference if it
happened to hit us. However, I&#8217;m morally certain they were
Germans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe they were. What are we going to do
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay up here until we are absolutely certain we
have passed over the German lines. Then we&#8217;ll come
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The machine was high in the air now, and, peering intently over the
side, as he did, Chester was unable to make out anything below in the
early morning light.</p>

<p>But in the rear, soaring high in the air, although neither lad
realized it, a new danger threatened. When the presence of the
boys&#8217; plane had been discovered, a German craft had immediately
risen, and was now in pursuit.</p>

<p>Glancing over his shoulder, Chester was the first to discover that
they were followed. At the same moment that he perceived the pursuing
machine there came a shot from the enemy.</p>

<p>There was no need for Chester to cry out to Hal. The sound of the
shot told the latter of their danger, and he immediately threw the
speed lever over as far as it would go.</p>

<p>The machine bounded forward.</p>

<p>But the pursuer also came on faster than before; and, while it was
apparent that he was not lessening the distance between the two craft,
he nevertheless was still in range, and his rifle continued to crack.
However, neither the machine nor its three occupants were struck.</p>

<p>Chester took a snap shot at the other craft with his revolver, but
the bullet fell short. While the enemy could pepper them at will with
his rifle, a bullet from the lad&#8217;s revolver could not reach
him.</p>

<p>Hal heard the sound of Chester&#8217;s revolver, and called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hit him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Chester shouted back, &#8220;he&#8217;s too far
behind. But he&#8217;ll get us in a minute if we don&#8217;t do
something.&#8221; To himself he added: &#8220;If I only had a
rifle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You be ready with your revolver,&#8221; Hal called to his
friend, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll soon fix that. It&#8217;s our only
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abruptly he slackened the speed of the machine, and swiftly the
enemy came on. So suddenly had Hal acted that the man at the wheel of
the pursuing machine could not act promptly enough, and was within
range of Chester&#8217;s revolver before he could slow down.</p>

<p>As the first machine righted after its abrupt halt, Chester took
deliberate aim and fired, even at the moment that a bullet passed close
to his head.</p>

<p>There was a yell from the pursuing machine. A man leaped suddenly to
his feet, shaking the frail craft violently as he did so, waved his
arms once, twice, and toppled into space.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got one of &#8217;em,&#8221; Chester shouted to Hal, and
his lips shut grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; Hal shouted back.</p>

<p>Even Marquis realized that it was time to be pleased, and he sent up
a sharp bark of joy. His canine intelligence told him that something
that threatened had been overcome.</p>

<p>But the man at the wheel of the German aëroplane, now that he was
alone, was not minded to give up the chase. The machine darted at the
boys&#8217; craft suddenly, and, but for the fact that Hal at that very
moment happened to glance over his shoulder, the sharp-pointed prow of
the German craft would have cut them down.</p>

<p>With a sudden twist of the wheel, however, Hal sent the machine out
of the path of the German, and, as the enemy sped by, Chester took a
snap shot with his revolver.</p>

<p>Evidently he missed, for the German checked his plane and returned
to the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Hal to himself, &#8220;two can play at that
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he avoided the German rush; and then, wheeling his own
craft at the moment the German sped by, he dashed in pursuit. The
enemy, doing the work of two men, did not perceive this change in
tactics by his foes, and, even as he slowed down to turn and make
another attack, the point of the lad&#8217;s machine plowed into
him.</p>

<p>There was a ripping, tearing sound; the German plane wavered and
started to fall as the craft in which the boys were flying dashed by.
But, by a superhuman effort, the German succeeded in righting his
craft.</p>

<p>Then, holding the wheel steady with one hand, he calmly produced a
revolver and took deliberate aim at Hal.</p>

<p>There was a sharp crack, followed immediately by another, but Hal
was unharmed.</p>

<p>Realizing the German&#8217;s purpose, Chester&#8217;s weapon had
spoken a second before that of the enemy. The lad had not had time to
take careful aim, but the bullet sped true, striking the German
squarely in the forehead, even at the moment his finger pressed the
trigger of his own revolver.</p>

<p>Chester saw the man throw up his hands and fall backward. The German
plane, now without a hand to keep it steady, rocked crazily for several
moments, then turned turtle and went tumbling over and over toward the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get him, Chester?&#8221; asked Hal, who had not
turned his head, and therefore had not perceived his own danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I got him,&#8221; replied Chester simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; returned Hal. &#8220;And the machine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads now paused to take stock of their own damage, if any. There
was none. Not a German bullet had so much as struck the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not very good marksmen, are they?&#8221; said Hal,
with a slight grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t look that way,&#8221; returned Chester.
&#8220;However, maybe those fellows are not the best
specimens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221; asked Chester, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we might as well go on,&#8221; replied Hal.
&#8220;There may be some more of those German machines flying after us,
so I guess it behooves us to get away from here as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you are right,&#8221; Chester acquiesced.</p>

<p>Once more the aëroplane straightened itself out on its course and,
flying high&#8211;absolutely hidden from the ground by a dense mass of
black clouds that seemed to spring up as if by magic&#8211;sped on.</p>

<p>Hal, with firm hands on the wheel, kept his gaze directly ahead.
Chester settled himself comfortably in his seat again, and Marquis,
after sniffing about for several moments, finally composed himself to
sleep.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he was flying far above ground, the dog
had not shown a sign of nervousness or fright. Evidently he had no
fear. Possibly through his head flashed the thought that if these young
boys who were caring for him had saved him once, it was no more than
they would do again.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II.<br /><span
class='fss'>BEYOND THE ENEMY.</span></h2>

<p>Hal Paine and Chester Crawford, two young American lads, had already
seen much active service in the great European war of 1914, the
greatest war of all history.</p>

<p>With Hal&#8217;s mother they had been in the capital of Germany when
the conflagration broke out. In making their way from Berlin they had
been separated from Mrs. Paine and, thrown upon their resources, it
became necessary for them to make their way out of Germany alone, or
else to stay in Berlin for an indefinite time. The boys elected to
leave.</p>

<p>With Major Raoul Derevaux, a French Officer, then a captain, and
Captain Harry Anderson, an Englishman, they had finally succeeded in
making their way into the Belgian lines. They had witnessed the heroic
defense of the Belgians at Liège, and had themselves taken part in the
battle. Having accomplished several missions successfully, they had
come to be looked upon with the greatest respect by the Belgian
commander.</p>

<p>At Louvain Hal was wounded, and Chester had him conveyed to
Brussels. Here the lads again fell in with Captain Anderson, and,
through the good offices of the latter, eventually found themselves
attached to the British forces on the continent. They had gained favor
in the eyes of Sir John French, the British Field Marshal in command of
the British troops, and had successfully accomplished several difficult
missions.</p>

<p>Taken prisoners by the Germans, they had been saved from death at
the hands of a firing squad by the Emperor of Germany himself, and had
finally been taken back to Berlin.</p>

<p>In the streets of the German capital, one day, a message had been
put into their hands by an English prisoner, who declared that its
delivery to the Grand Duke Nicholas, commander of the hosts of the Czar
of Russia, was a matter of much moment.</p>

<p>Displaying great resourcefulness and bravery, the lads had succeeded
in escaping from Berlin in an aëroplane, as narrated in &#8220;The Boy
Allies on the Firing Line,&#8221; the same in which, at the opening of
this story, we find them flying swiftly eastward.</p>

<p>Crack revolver shots, and having skill in the use of the sword and
with their fists, the boys had fought themselves out of many ticklish
situations. And now, free again, they were making all speed to deliver
the message from the combined leaders of two countries to Grand Duke
Nicholas, a message that would mean closer coöperation between the
Russians in the east and the British and French forces in the west.</p>

<p>The Russian campaign so far could hardly be called a success. True,
the first German advance into Poland, with Warsaw as its object, had
been checked, and the invader had been driven back; but the mighty
legions of the Czar of all the Russias could not be mobilized with the
swiftness of the Kaiser&#8217;s troops; and, when mobilized, could not
be transported to the front with the same dispatch.</p>

<p>Reënforced after their first defeat in Poland, the Germans had begun
a new drive into the heart of Poland. Day after day they drew nearer
and nearer to the little capital, Warsaw&#8211;the Russians retreating
before them.</p>

<p>But now, within two days&#8217; march of Warsaw, the Russians held
steadily, and, try as he might, the German commander could not break
through this line of steel. Grand Duke Nicholas, commander-in-chief of
the Russian armies&#8211;who at first had been with the southern army
opposing the Austrians and advancing upon Cracow, in Galicia&#8211;had
hurried north, to take personal command in Poland.</p>

<p>His presence had instilled new vigor into the Russian troops, and,
after several days of defensive action, the Russian troops had at last
resumed the offensive.</p>

<p>It was toward this mighty army that the aëroplane that had borne the
boys through the heart of the enemy was now flying swiftly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;that by this time we
must have passed the German lines. I guess we might as well go down a
bit and have a look around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly the machine glided nearer the earth. The day was dark
and foggy, and at first the lads could discern nothing below but a
great blur.</p>

<p>They drew closer.</p>

<p>At that moment there came a shot from below. Hal instinctively threw
over the lever in an effort to take the craft out of harm&#8217;s
way.</p>

<p>But the machine did not respond to his touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That one bullet must
have put us out of commission. We&#8217;ll have to go down, or be shot
to pieces up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gently the little craft glided toward the earth; and now the boys
could make out the objects below.</p>

<p>On all sides, stretching out as far as the eye could see, was a
mighty mass of moving men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Germans?&#8221; asked Chester anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see,&#8221; replied Hal briefly.</p>

<p>It was apparent now that those below, realizing that the aircraft
was falling, would not fire at it again. With upturned eyes thousands
of men watched the flight of the little plane, as it soared down among
them.</p>

<p>Hal looked closely at the men, as the machine drew near the ground,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are not Germans; Russians, that&#8217;s what they
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester raised a feeble cheer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>Marquis, aroused by the sound of the lad&#8217;s voices, arose and
stretched. Even he seemed pleased.</p>

<p>And now the aëroplane bumped the ground, and the lads stepped out to
see a long line of rifle barrels confronting them.</p>

<p>The lads threw up their hands instantly, but Marquis&#8217;s back
bristled and he growled threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet!&#8221; Chester commanded, and the dog grew still.
An officer approached the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you here?&#8221; he demanded, in some language the
lads could not understand.</p>

<p>The lads shook their heads, and the officer tried again, this time
in German.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you here?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>As briefly as possible, Hal, acting as spokesman, explained. The
officer&#8217;s incredulous gaze grew more so as the lad went on with
his story. When the lad had finished, he said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal was angry in a second. He took a step toward the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The officer stood his ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe you. The tale you tell is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester stepped into the breach. He took Hal by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course such a tale is hard to believe,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But, nevertheless, it is true. We carry an important message for
the Grand Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the officer, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
will see him. He is too busy to give up his time to listen to such a
tale as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this moment a second officer, apparently the other&#8217;s
superior, approached. To him, upon request, Hal repeated his story.
This officer also looked incredulous, but the result was different.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell a very strange story,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it
is not for me to pass upon its veracity. You shall be given an audience
with the Grand Duke; but, mark me well, if it is found that you have
been lying&#8211;that you have nothing of importance, it will go hard
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no fear of that, sir,&#8221; said Chester
briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then. Follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads did as ordered, Marquis trailing along after them. Through
thousands of rapidly-moving men the lads followed the officer, and at
last, after more than an hour&#8217;s walk, came to a stop, upon
command, in front of a large, bewhiskered man, of imposing military
stature.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said the officer who had conducted them,
&#8220;is Grand Duke Nicholas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer looked down on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>The officer repeated the story the boys had told him. The Grand Duke
grew greatly interested as the story progressed, and, when the message
was mentioned, he interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have been expecting such a
message.&#8221; He turned to the two lads. &#8220;Do you bear
it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Hal bowed in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then give it to me!&#8221; he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Chester reached in his pocket, and a moment more the Grand Duke
eagerly clutched the paper the lad handed him&#8211;a paper they had
gone through so much to deliver.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke read the message through twice, sitting on his horse
without a move, his face a perfect blank. Then he thrust it into his
pocket and turned once more to the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Captain, you will
see that they are brought to my quarters to-night at eight
o&#8217;clock. I desire to question them. In the meantime, see that
they are fed and clothed properly, for it is very cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer saluted, and the Grand Duke rode away, closely followed
by the members of his staff. At a sign from the officer in whose charge
they had been left, the lads followed him.</p>

<p>Toward the rear of the army they continued their way, coming at last
upon a row of tents. Into one of these the officer led the way, the
lads and the dog following him.</p>

<p>Here the officer quickly set out food, and the boys fell to with a
will, for it was a long time since a morsel had passed their lips.
Then, having satisfied their appetites, they informed the officer that
they would like to rest.</p>

<p>The officer nodded, and showed them into another tent, where two
bunks had been prepared. With a word of thanks, the boys climbed in,
and the officer left them alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;we have accomplished our
mission successfully. What are we going to do now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking,&#8221; Hal replied, &#8220;of how life
on this side of the war arena would go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean stay here and not return to France?&#8221; asked
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. I have read that the Russian Cossacks are terrible
fighters. I would like to see some of them in action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so would I,&#8221; declared Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;Then, if you are
agreeable, when we see the Grand Duke to-night, I shall ask him if he
cannot arrange to assign us to duties with the Russian army.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment the two lads, tired out, were fast asleep, with
Marquis on guard.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III.<br /><span
class='fss'>UNDER THE BEAR.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;So, Your Excellency,&#8221; Hal concluded, &#8220;you may see
that we have had considerable active service.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Russian Grand Duke Nicholas did not reply for some moments. It
was plain that he was greatly impressed, as he had been greatly
interested in the boys&#8217; adventures since they had taken service
with the Allies just before the defense of Liège.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;you certainly have seen
considerable service; and, in bringing me this paper
safely&#8221;&#8211;the Grand Duke tapped his breast
pocket&#8211;&#8220;you have rendered an invaluable service to our
cause. I am indeed glad to know you. Now, if there is anything I can do
to show my appreciation, you may consider it done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering their conversation of a few hours before, Hal started to
speak, then hesitated. Realizing that the lad had something he felt a
delicacy of saying, the Grand Duke said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, out with it. What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Your Excellency,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;my friend and
I would like to see service with the Russian army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Chester broke into the conversation. &#8220;We
have talked it over, and we have decided that we would like to see
service in the Eastern theater of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm-m-m,&#8221; said the Duke, stroking his mustache,
&#8220;and have you picked out the branch of the service to which you
would like to be attached?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Hal; &#8220;we have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221; questioned the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cavalry, Your Excellency&#8211;the Cossacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke jumped to his feet in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You have certainly
picked out the most difficult thing you could have asked me. Still, I
have no doubt it can be arranged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it will inconvenience you, your Excellency&#8213;&#8221;
Chester began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! Tut!&#8221; the Grand Duke interrupted him, with a wave
of his hand. &#8220;It shall be done. Consider the matter settled. Do
you know anything of the Cossacks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;We have
read considerable about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant
you do not know overly much about them. I&#8217;ll tell you a little,
if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would be glad to hear Your Excellency,&#8221; said
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cossacks,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;from whom
the Russian cavalry is mainly drawn, form a community within the
Russian Empire enjoying special rights and privileges in return for
military service. Each Cossack village holds its land as a commune, and
the village assembly fixes local taxation and elects the local judges.
It has been estimated that the Cossacks will place 400,000 armed men in
the field in this war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both in historical writings and in fiction the Cossacks are
often represented as little better than savages. But this is a mistake,
for the level of education among the Cossacks is higher than in the
rest of Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the Cossacks have always been fighters&#8211;none better
in the world. They have won renown wherever they have fought by their
daring and bravery. But the Cossacks, to a certain degree, are
clannish&#8211;they do not take kindly to those not of their kind.
Which is the reason, as I said, you had made it hard for me when you
asked to be assigned to a Cossack regiment. By the way, can you
ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;We are both
used to the saddle, having ridden much in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;I will see that it
is arranged. Report to me here in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads saluted and took their departure, returning to the spot
where they had sought rest only a few short hours before.</p>

<p>It was about seven o&#8217;clock the following morning when they
again stood in the presence of the Grand Duke. With him was an officer
in a dark uniform, that gave evidence of having seen hard service, but
gaily bedecked nevertheless. He was a large man, fully six feet in
height, and built proportionately. The Grand Duke motioned the boys to
approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, indicating the officer who stood beside
him, &#8220;is your future commander, General Ivan Jorvitch. I have
informed him of your request, and my command that it be
granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads saluted the general, and he acknowledged the salute
stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not at all sure as to how they will be received by the
men, sir,&#8221; he said to the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see that they are well treated,&#8221; replied the
Grand Duke. &#8220;My commands are not to be treated lightly. These
lads will be attached to your staff with the rank of lieutenants. They
are not to serve in the ranks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency,&#8221; said the general, saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find, general,&#8221; continued the Grand Duke,
&#8220;that you may depend upon them to the limit. I fancy I am a good
judge of character. They have already done me an invaluable service.
They may do more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke then proceeded to relate some of the lads&#8217;
exploits and informed the general of the message they had brought.</p>

<p>General Jorvitch thawed immediately upon hearing this, and extended
a hand to each lad in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to have you with me,&#8221; he told them
sincerely. &#8220;I feared, at first, that the Grand Duke was trying an
experiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the general&#8217;s first gruffness the lads had taken a
liking to him. Straight and erect, with a flashing eye, he was the beau
ideal of a soldier. Still, there was a slight twinkle in the corner of
those same eyes, which proclaimed him a man, though stern, of a kindly
disposition.</p>

<p>The lads thanked the general, and their interview with the Grand
Duke concluded, followed their new commander back to his quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been ordered to advance,&#8221; the general informed
them as they made their way along, &#8220;and as soon as I have
introduced you to your fellow officers and procured you uniforms and
horses, we shall proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later, in true Russian garb and astride two fiery chargers,
the lads made their way forward with the rest of the troop. In all
there were probably 10,000 Cossacks in this advance.</p>

<p>With one of the Cossack officers, a young lieutenant, huge in
stature and pleasant of face, the lads at once struck up a friendship.
He stood at least six feet six and seemed a Goliath in strength. He it
was who picked their horses for them, and obtained their uniforms. Some
of the other officers, while not openly hostile, still were disdainful
of the two boys, and plainly not well pleased with their company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any idea where we are bound?&#8221; asked Hal in
German of their new friend, who introduced himself with a swagger as
&#8220;Lieutenant Alexis Vergoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lodz; and when we get there we&#8217;ll make the Germans hard
to find,&#8221; was the answer, made in a loud, boasting tone.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester glanced at each other and smiled quizzically. The
same thought was in the mind of each: &#8220;He talks too boastfully to
be much of a fighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis noticed the interchange of glances, and the quizzical smiles.
He realized their meaning in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I won&#8217;t fight, eh?&#8221; he said loudly.
&#8220;Alexis Vergoff not fight? Ho! Ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed loudly. The boys were not
impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and more of it,&#8221; thought Hal to himself.</p>

<p>Chester was of the same opinion, but he did not say so aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; continued Alexis, &#8220;I&#8217;ve fought more
battles than you will ever hear of. I have killed twenty
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty is a good many,&#8221; said Hal softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;True! True!&#8221; shouted Alexis, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll kill
twenty more in the next battle, just to show you. You shall see what
sort of a man Alexis Vergoff is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid we shall see too soon,&#8221; muttered Chester to
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; went on Alexis, &#8220;it was only a month ago,
before being ordered to the front, that I slew five men
single-handed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; muttered Hal. &#8220;I wish I had not
started him. He&#8217;ll never let up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was at my mother&#8217;s home,&#8221; continued Alexis.
&#8220;I reached home unexpectedly. Five men had surrounded her and
threatened to kill her unless she gave them money she kept in the
house. One had drawn a knife just as I entered the room. No one saw me
enter, and I was upon them before they knew it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I picked up the man with the knife as though he had been a
child, and threw him bodily upon the other four. He had no time to
strike at me with his knife or even drop it. The other four went down
in a heap. The knife of the first man was buried in one of his
companions, and so there were only three who could stagger to their
feet. I picked up a lamp that stood on the table. This I hurled at
another. It struck him squarely on the head, and rebounded against the
head of another. Both men went down with cracked skulls. The fifth man
turned to flee, but picking up a knife, I hurled it after him. It stuck
in his back, and he ran half a mile before he fell down dead. The next
man jumped for me&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said Hal, laughing. &#8220;You said there
were only five, and you have already killed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; muttered Alexis, though in no wise taken aback.
&#8220;It was in another fight where I killed six men. I always get
them mixed up. In that fight&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save that for another time,&#8221; said Hal, restraining his
laughter with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to hear it?&#8221; demanded Alexis in
surprise. &#8220;I always like to hear a story of a good
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you would rather tell one,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>Alexis looked very much crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I made that up?&#8221; he asked in
consternation. &#8220;Why, I can tell you of other fights I have had
that&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it at all,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;I am
willing to admit that you can draw the long bow to the Queen&#8217;s
taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Draw the long bow?&#8221; repeated Alexis, puzzled.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do for me to tell you,&#8221; replied Hal
chuckling to himself. &#8220;Ask someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis turned to Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what he means? Will you tell me?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know what he means,&#8221; replied Chester, laughing,
&#8220;and I believe he is right. However, it wouldn&#8217;t do for me
to tell you either. You must ask someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis turned to the man on his right, and repeated his question.
The man acknowledged he knew no more what the expression meant than
Alexis himself.</p>

<p>Alexis accosted several other officers, but with no better luck. He
turned to Hal aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have said that unless you tell me what you
mean,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Colonel Bluekoff, perhaps he may tell you,&#8221; said
Hal.</p>

<p>Alexis approached the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, sir?&#8221; asked the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said Alexis, saluting, &#8220;can you tell me
what drawing the long bow means?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel looked at him in amazement. Then he said sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back to your place, sir. This is no time for
joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis returned to his place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Alexis, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll find out, if
I have to put off killing one of my enemies to ask him about
it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV.<br /><span
class='fss'>LODZ.</span></h2>

<p>There came a sudden command from Colonel Bluekoff, and the regiment
to which Hal and Chester were attached galloped forward. The advance
guard could be seen falling back, firing as they retreated upon the
main body of cavalry. They had encountered a force of the enemy.</p>

<p>With Colonel Bluekoff leading, his sword whirling about his head,
the troop dashed forward at a charge. As they went by, the retreating
advance guard reformed and also dashed forward with them. From ahead
came several puffs of smoke and the cracking of rifles, and here and
there a man fell to the ground. But the rest dashed on.</p>

<p>The Cossacks did not fire a shot and soon the enemy had disappeared
in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;A reconnoitering force that must have gotten around Lodz in
some way,&#8221; Colonel Bluekoff told his officers.</p>

<p>The regiment now fell back upon the main body.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s two more,&#8221; said Alexis complacently to Hal
and Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more what?&#8221; demanded Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more of the enemy I have killed,&#8221; said Alexis
without a suspicion of a smile. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see them go
down when I fired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we fired a shot,&#8221; said Chester,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h,&#8221; whispered Alexis, &#8220;do you want to get me
into trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know I&#8217;d get into trouble if the
colonel knew I had fired without orders, even though I killed two of
the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; muttered Hal to himself. &#8220;He is the
limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis showed his revolver to Hal and Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little invention of my own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;ll leave it to you, you didn&#8217;t hear me when I fired, did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Chester emphatically, &#8220;I did
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; exclaimed Alexis triumphantly. &#8220;You
see,&#8221; he explained, patting the revolver, &#8220;that&#8217;s how
I was able to kill two of the enemy without you hearing the sound of my
revolver. Little invention of my own. No noise, no smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal stretched out a hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have a look at that wonderful weapon,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Alexis drew back, and returned the revolver quickly to its
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said seriously. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust
it out of my own hand. If it&#8217;s not handled just right, it might
get out of commission, and I don&#8217;t believe I could make another
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal whistled softly to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the best I ever heard,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve heard a whole lot of &#8217;em at one time or
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis rode ahead as complacently as before, whistling softly to
himself, pausing once just long enough to turn to Hal and ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you decided yet to tell me what you mean by drawing the
long bow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While you have a gun like that in your possession, I
wouldn&#8217;t tell you for the world,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>Now the column, at a command from General Jorvitch, increased its
pace. In the distance could be made out the buildings of a large
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lodz,&#8221; said Alexis briefly, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester acknowledged they understood. The troop continued
onward.</p>

<p>Lodz, an important railroad center, was one of the most important
towns in Poland, and the Grand Duke had decided that it must be held at
all hazards. There was already a large body of troops stationed there,
but the Grand Duke had not considered them sufficient to hold off the
ever-increasing horde of the Kaiser. Even now large masses of infantry
were being thrown forward to reënforce the troops already there.</p>

<p>Acclaimed on all hands, the Cossacks rode rapidly through the town
and went into camp at the side facing the Germans. Outposts were thrown
out and the Cossacks sat down to a day of waiting.</p>

<p>Having secured permission, Hal, Chester and Alexis walked back
toward the town. For several hours they strolled about, looking in the
windows, and purchasing several small articles.</p>

<p>The people of Lodz were serene in their belief that there was no
danger of a German invasion, in spite of the nearness of the foe. Shops
and stores, theaters and all buildings were gaily decorated, and
thousands promenaded the streets. The city was in festival attire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like they were preparing for a celebration,&#8221; Hal
remarked to Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it does,&#8221; the latter returned. &#8220;But
it wouldn&#8217;t take the Germans long to wreck the town, if they once
got here. You remember Louvain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t get here,&#8221; Alexis broke in.
&#8220;One Cossack is always good for ten Germans. Why, I
remember&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us later,&#8221; Hal interrupted. &#8220;We want to look
about a little now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three entered a store, where, Alexis&#8217; eye having been
caught by a red necktie, the Cossack purchased it. The necktie in his
pocket, he leaned over the counter and asked the salesman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what does drawing the long bow mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal and Chester burst into a loud guffaw, and the salesman, drawing
back, suddenly turned and disappeared.</p>

<p>A man in civilian garb, who stood nearby, also broke into a loud
guffaw. Alexis turned on him angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m laughing at you,&#8221; replied the man
calmly. &#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Plainly Alexis was astonished at this reply. He drew back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said pleasantly.
&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are these children you have with you?&#8221; demanded
the man.</p>

<p>Hal answered this question himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your business,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said the man, stepping forward.
&#8220;What if I should make it some of my business?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>The man, large, though somewhat stout, with a red, evil-looking
face, stepped quickly forward, and tapped Hal lightly on the cheek with
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let that teach you not to talk back to your elders,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And let that teach you not to interfere in other
people&#8217;s business,&#8221; said Hal, also taking a step forward,
and tapping his opponent lightly on the cheek.</p>

<p>The man grew very angry, and his face turned a dull red. He raised
his cane, and struck sharply at Hal. But Hal was not there, and a
moment later the man received a sharp jolt on the jaw as Hal&#8217;s
fist went home.</p>

<p>The man let out a string of epithets and rushed at the boy. But the
latter was prepared for him, and drove him back with straight rights
and lefts; one blow brought a tiny stream of blood from the man&#8217;s
nose.</p>

<p>He drew back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will answer for that,&#8221; he said quietly, and
turning, walked off.</p>

<p>Hal shrugged his shoulders, and at that moment the salesman whom
Alexis had frightened a few moments before came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who that was?&#8221; he asked of Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the lad, &#8220;and what&#8217;s more, I
don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the salesman, &#8220;the man whom you just
struck is Count de Reslau, and he is very influential. You have made a
bad enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if he is the King of Poland,&#8221;
replied Hal. &#8220;No man can hit me and get away without a return
blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis, meanwhile, had been gazing at Hal in astonishment. Now he
approached and laid a hand on the lad&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;A real fighter!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;A man after my
own heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you doing much fighting just a moment
ago,&#8221; said Hal, somewhat nettled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Alexis. &#8220;Do you think I
wanted to get in trouble? Suppose an officer had come along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;suppose he had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had, we would have lost our liberty for all time to
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that why you didn&#8217;t fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Discipline in the Russian army is more strict than in
any army in the world; but you are certainly a fighter. The way you
stood up to that man reminds me of the time I&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; broke in Chester, not wanting to hear any
more bluster, &#8220;and let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three left the store, and continued their stroll about the town.
As they were passing an unfrequented corner, six men suddenly sprang
out upon them, armed with clubs and knives.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester immediately backed up against a wall, and turned to
fight off their assailants; but not so Alexis.</p>

<p>With a loud shout he rushed upon the six who had attacked them.
Right and left flew his huge fists, striking out blindly. One man
toppled to the ground. A stabbing wrist was caught in the
Cossack&#8217;s great hand, and thrown twisting through the air. And at
the same time Alexis called to Hal and Chester:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you shall see how Alexis can fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hal and Chester had no mind to let Alexis fight the whole crowd
of assailants. They sprang to his aid.</p>

<p>Alexis drove his right fist, with tremendous power behind it, right
into the face of the second man, and the latter went down to rise no
more for some time to come.</p>

<p>Hal, with a sudden spring, clinched with one of the assailants, and
the two went tumbling to the ground. Chester and another of the enemy
were also rolling on the ground.</p>

<p>Alexis reached one huge hand and grasped another of the foe by the
back of the neck, and lifted him, kicking and struggling, from his
feet. The last man turned to flee, but he had reckoned without the
giant Cossack.</p>

<p>Still holding one man by the scruff of the neck, the Cossack took a
step forward and, with his free hand, grasped the last man by the back
of the neck also. Then, holding one in either hand, he walked calmly to
where Hal and his opponent were engaged.</p>

<p>Hal was uppermost, and Alexis, seizing a chance when the lad&#8217;s
head was out of the way, dashed the man he held in his left hand,
headfirst, against the head of the enemy on the ground. There was a
crunch, and both men lay still.</p>

<p>Then, with his other victim in his left hand, Alexis walked over to
where Chester and his opponent were rolling about, and performed a
similar operation. Then he lent each lad a hand in getting to his feet,
after which he turned and surveyed the field of battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six!&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough for
one day. Come on! Let&#8217;s get away from here before some officer
comes along and sees us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys looked at the giant Cossack with amazement written large
upon their faces. From the first time that he had boasted to them, they
had put him down as anything but a fighter, in spite of his huge size.
But the quickness with which he had disposed of six men showed them
that they had been wrong.</p>

<p>As they walked along, it was plain to the lads that something was
troubling Alexis; and at last Hal was moved to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Alexis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The huge Cossack looked at the lad for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use my telling you, but I will. I want to know
what you meant by &#8216;drawing the long bow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><span
class='fss'>ALEXIS IN BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>Both lads laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll learn before many days,&#8221; said Hal,
&#8220;and I am not as sure as I was about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; agreed Chester.</p>

<p>The three made their way back to their posts, where Alexis
immediately insisted on donning his new red necktie. Marquis, who had
been left behind while the three friends made a tour of the city,
greeted them with joyful barks. He had made friends with the big
Cossack, and the latter had taken quite a fancy to the dog.</p>

<p>Hardly had the three retired to their positions, when an air of
excitement throughout the troops became apparent. There was bustle and
some slight confusion and shouted commands. A moment later and a body
of 5,000 Cossacks, armed and spurred, stood beside their horses, ready
to mount and ride at the command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose we are going?&#8221; asked Hal of
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any idea,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but it
looks as though there was a little fighting to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what!&#8221; exclaimed Alexis, who stood beside
the two lads. &#8220;Now you shall see how we handle the
Germans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mount!&#8221; came the command.</p>

<p>As one man, the troop sprang to the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; came the next order, and the Cossacks started
forward at a gallop.</p>

<p>Good riders themselves, Hal and Chester could not but envy the
riding prowess of their companions. Accounted among the best riders in
the world, the Cossacks who now dashed forward hurled themselves toward
the enemy with reckless abandon. Their lances held high in one hand,
each brandished a large revolver in his other. The bridles lay across
the horses&#8217; necks, the riders guiding their mounts by the
pressure of their knees.</p>

<p>And so they swept forward, dashing swiftly over the few miles of
open ground toward the spot where the Germans were known to be
entrenched.</p>

<p>The enemy greeted them with a hail of bullets, but they faltered
not. Men fell and horses dropped, but there was no hesitation among
those left.</p>

<p>Now a bugle sounded, and they dashed on with greater ferocity than
before.</p>

<p>Squadrons of German cavalry issued forth to meet them. They crashed
with a terrible shock. The impact was terrific, and horses and riders
on both sides reeled back.</p>

<p>But the Cossacks were the first to recover, and they spurred their
horses into the thick of the enemy. The sweep of their lances and the
fire from their automatics were deadly. There was no pause in the
Russian attack.</p>

<p>Cutting and slashing, the squadron to which Hal, Chester and Alexis
were attached was soon in the midst of the foe. Not unused to such
encounters, the lads nevertheless found themselves hard put to keep
their seats and ward off the blows of their foes.</p>

<p>But with each moment they gained confidence, and finally were
fighting with the best of them. Hal caught a descending lance on his
upraised sword, and raising his revolver took a snap shot at his
opponent. The latter threw his arms high, and toppled from his horse.
Chester, by a quick move, escaped a revolver shot aimed at him by a
German officer, and the lad&#8217;s own weapon spoke sharply. His aim
was true, and the German dropped.</p>

<p>Now the Germans began to give ground. It was impossible to stand in
the face of the terrible Cossack charge. The Russians pressed the
retreating foe closely.</p>

<p>But now new forces of Germans dashed forward to drive back the
Cossacks, or at least to protect the retreat of their companions.</p>

<p>The Cossacks dashed into these fresh troops with the same abandon
they had first charged. But this time the result was different. Tired
by the furious work, they were thrown back by the German
reënforcements, and in spite of heroic efforts, were forced to retire
slowly.</p>

<p>Flushed with this success, the Germans pressed on. The fighting was
man to man, horse to horse, and hand to hand. Not for once had Alexis
left the side of the two lads and none of the three had so far been
injured, although men dropped on all sides of them.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a command from Colonel Bluekoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Immediately the squadron to which the lads were attached hurled
itself forward once more, right into the thickest of the fray, in the
face of overwhelming numbers. They dashed forward with the fury of
madmen, shouting and yelling as they charged.</p>

<p>For a moment the Germans gave back, so terrible was the charge of
this mere handful of Cossacks, but for a moment only; then they came on
again. From all sides they bore down on the squadron, now completely
cut off from the main body of troops, seeking to annihilate them.</p>

<p>There was no order to surrender from the German commander, nor would
one have been heeded for the matter of that. At a quick command, the
Cossacks formed a little square, back to back, and awaited the attack
of the enemy.</p>

<p>It came upon the instant. Upon the Russian horsemen the Germans
hurled themselves bravely, cutting and shooting as they came on. The
Cossacks gave blow for blow, and in spite of the fierce charge,
maintained their unbroken front, though men fell here and there. Unable
to pierce this line of steel, the Germans drew off.</p>

<p>Given this little breathing space, Hal and Chester, standing side by
side, took in the scene about them. Of the little troop of Cossacks
there remained now possibly a hundred men. Their support, the lads
could see, desperately engaged elsewhere, would be unable to come to
their assistance. It was up to them to fight it out alone.</p>

<p>Colonel Bluekoff was down, having been pierced a few moments before
by a German bullet. Among these few men there were, besides Alexis, but
two minor officers unharmed. At that moment Alexis himself took
command.</p>

<p>His sword raised aloft, he turned flashing eyes upon his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will we surrender?&#8221; he shouted, and answered his own
question: &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>A wild cheer from his men was the reply. The huge Cossack turned to
the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will fight till the last,&#8221; he said calmly.
&#8220;Are you with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; said Hal simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; Chester agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Alexis.</p>

<p>He turned once more toward the enemy, who, it was evident, were
preparing for another attack upon the little band. The latter stood
quietly, awaiting the charge; and in a moment it came.</p>

<p>Urging their horses on at a gallop, the Germans came rapidly
forward. There was the clash of steel on steel as the enemy hurled
themselves upon three sides of the little square simultaneously.
Russians and Germans dropped together, fighting till the last.</p>

<p>But the odds against them were too great. Dense masses of the
Germans swooped down upon them, engulfing them, overpowering them. Hal,
engaged with a big German officer, had just succeeded in parrying a
thrust of the other&#8217;s sword, when someone from behind struck him
a heavy blow over the head. The lad fell from his horse without a
sound.</p>

<p>Chester, seeing his friend fall, fought his way toward Hal. He was
just about to leap from his horse by his chum&#8217;s side, when a tall
German trooper brought the flat of his sword down on the lad&#8217;s
head. Chester also went hurtling to the ground.</p>

<p>And now Alexis, with a few remaining men, was left to fight the
enemy alone. His sword whirling around his head in great sweeps, and an
empty revolver clutched tightly in his left hand; his teeth bared in a
snarl and his eyes flashing angrily, this great Cossack stood off his
foes.</p>

<p>Four men sprang upon him at once. Putting spurs to his horse, the
giant dashed in between them. Two he cut down with lightning-like
slashes of his sword, and a third he disposed of by hurling his empty
revolver squarely into his face. The sword of the fourth pierced him
through the left arm, but before the German could regain his balance
after this thrust, Alexis&#8217; sweeping sword had laid him low
also.</p>

<p>The giant Cossack was now the last of his troop in condition to
fight. Suddenly his horse staggered, and went to its knees. With a
quick move, Alexis freed himself and leaped from the saddle just as the
animal, dying from a pistol wound in its head, toppled to the
ground.</p>

<p>Alexis leaped up lightly and turned again to face his foes.</p>

<p>A German officer urged his horse forward, seeking to ride him down.
As the horse approached, Alexis fell on one knee, and the horse,
pierced by his sword, fell to the ground. The officer leaped from the
animal&#8217;s back, but before he could bring his revolver to bear
upon Alexis, the latter had pierced him through with a thrust of his
sword.</p>

<p>A dozen of the enemy sprang upon him. With his sword sweeping around
his head, seeming to make a circle of fire, the great Cossack held them
at bay. One ventured to spring at him, and without even stopping the
whirl of his weapon, Alexis dropped him at his feet.</p>

<p>More Germans sprang to the attack&#8211;ten, twenty, thirty of them.
Hopelessly outnumbered, and believing that the end was near, Alexis
gave up his defensive tactics and leaped into the very midst of his
foes. For a moment they gave way before him, then closed in again like
a pack of hungry wolves. Here and there the giant&#8217;s sword darted
out and men dropped beneath its thrust.</p>

<p>Cutting and thrusting with his dripping sword, and striking out with
his naked fist, Alexis fought on. A sword pierced him through the
shoulder, but the man who had aimed the thrust paid the penalty with
his life. Two men closed in, and as the Cossack struck out at the one
on his left with his fist, the second German seized his sword arm.</p>

<p>With a roar like that of an angry bull, Alexis gave a mighty wrench,
and the sword came free. At the same moment he felt a sting in his
right arm. A bullet had struck him. The giant scarcely felt his wounds,
although he was bleeding now in a dozen places. Before him, the ground
was full of dark swaying faces. His sword found another human sheath,
and being unable to withdraw it quickly enough to meet another of his
foes, he left it there and turned upon his enemies with his bare
hands.</p>

<p>He snatched a revolver from the ground, and not taking time to aim,
dashed it into the face of the nearest man, and then dashed forward,
hitting out with his naked fists.</p>

<p>Vaguely he noticed the sameness of the faces about him. A short wiry
man sprang at him, and with a broken sword, stabbed him in the left
shoulder. Alexis caught him by the throat with his right hand, and the
man gave a choking screech as he lifted him clear off the ground.</p>

<p>As he did so, someone behind him struck him a heavy blow on the head
with the butt of a revolver. With a last furious effort he turned upon
his foes, and dashed the man he held by the throat full into their
faces; fell forward upon the body and, with a great sob, he shuddered
and lay still.</p>

<p>And there, on the battlefield on the plains of Poland, lay the
bodies of the two American lads and, a short distance away, that of
Alexis, the giant Cossack, their friend.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI.<br /><span
class='fss'>MARQUIS.</span></h2>

<p>The Russian cavalry, outnumbered by the Germans, had continued to
give ground and the Germans were still in pursuit. But now, from the
distance arose a cloud of dust, and a moment later, in a headlong dash
to save their companions, came a second body of Cossack cavalry, 5,000
strong, to give battle to the Germans.</p>

<p>Down they came upon the unprepared Germans, with yells and shouts,
their horses running free. At the same time that part of the first
Cossack body which still remained reformed and sprang forward.</p>

<p>The Germans turned and fled.</p>

<p>Then from the trenches came forth columns of infantry, supported by
field batteries, and in a moment these had opened upon the advancing
Russian horsemen; but in spite of this hail of death, the Cossacks did
not falter nor pause. Straight up to the mouth of the field guns they
rode&#8211;sabering the gunners right and left&#8211;and in a few
moments these had been silenced.</p>

<p>Then the Cossacks turned their attention to the infantry, which,
firing with machine-like precision and accuracy, dealt havoc to the
ranks of the Russian horsemen and mowed them down.</p>

<p>Several squadrons of Cossacks dismounted and approached the foe on
foot, and soon the fighting became hand to hand. The standard-bearer
suddenly threw up his hands and fell over backward, the colors
fluttering to the ground.</p>

<p>A German officer, thinking to capture the flag, jumped forward, and
leaning down laid his hand upon it; but at that moment a hairy,
snarling body sprang forward, straight at the German&#8217;s throat.
The latter released his hold on the flag and jumped to his feet to ward
off the attack of this strange enemy, which he could not at first make
out.</p>

<p>But this new enemy was not to be shaken off. His teeth found their
mark, and with a cry, the German tumbled to earth.</p>

<p>The newcomer was Marquis.</p>

<p>Separated from Hal and Chester, Marquis, though a battle dog, had
become uneasy at their absence and set out to find them. He had
advanced with the second troop of Cossacks, and seeing the dead upon
the field, had been trying to pick out the bodies of the two lads.</p>

<p>But when the Russian standard-bearer, almost beside him, had been
shot down and the German had leaped for the colors, Marquis had turned
from the search of his friends to dispose of his lifelong enemy.</p>

<p>As Marquis&#8217; foe went to the ground, a second German sprang
forward and, aiming a kick at the dog, also stooped and started to
raise the colors. Marquis, disregarding the kick, seized upon the flag
with his teeth at the same moment.</p>

<p>Then came a tug of war. Snarling, and with bristling back, Marquis
pulled at the standard. Crying out hoarse epithets, the German pulled
also; but neither made any headway.</p>

<p>Realizing that the dog was a match for him, the German uttered a
fierce imprecation, dropped his hold on the flag, stepped back and
aimed his revolver.</p>

<p>But the dog was ready for him. He had released his hold upon the
flag almost as soon as had the German, and his canine reasoning told
him the German&#8217;s object. Before the German could pull the
trigger, Marquis was ready for him, and hurled his body straight at the
German&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>He had gauged the distance accurately enough, and beneath the shock
the officer was hurled to the ground. He attempted to fight off his
four-footed assailant, but he was no match for the angry dog.</p>

<p>This adversary disposed of, Marquis calmly returned to the flag,
picked it up in his mouth, carried it to the commander of the squadron
and put it in his hand. The commander took the time to pat Marquis on
the head, and utter some words of praise.</p>

<p>But Marquis had no time to listen to these. He had other work to do,
and had disappeared almost before the Cossack ceased speaking.</p>

<p>Hither and thither over the field of battle Marquis made his way,
sniffing the bodies of the dead, and licking the faces of the wounded.
For an hour he wandered about, and at last his search was rewarded.</p>

<p>From near him came a feeble moan. Marquis pricked up his ears.
Surely he recognized that voice. The moan came again. Marquis hesitated
no longer. He had recognized the voice of Hal. Quickly he sprang to
where the lad lay and poked his cold muzzle into the boy&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>Hal turned feebly on his side and put out a hand before he realized
what had touched him. Then he succeeded in raising himself on one arm
and threw the other around Marquis&#8217; neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marquis!&#8221; he almost sobbed. &#8220;Where is
Chester?&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently the dog understood his question, for he jumped away and
began nosing other bodies nearby. And at last he came upon Chester. The
latter also was returning to consciousness. With some difficulty Hal
staggered to his feet and made his way to his friend&#8217;s side. He
turned to Marquis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get some water!&#8221; he commanded, and paused to see if the
dog understood.</p>

<p>Marquis bounded away, and returned a few moments later with a
well-filled canteen, in his mouth. Hastily Hal removed the stopper and
poured some of the water down Chester&#8217;s throat. Then he took a
drink himself.</p>

<p>Thus refreshed, Chester sat up and looked around. Hal did the same.
It was indeed a terrible sight that met their eyes. As far as they
could see, bodies of dead and wounded men lay scattered about. Hal
shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible!&#8221; he exclaimed. Then: &#8220;I wonder where
Alexis is?&#8221; He turned to Marquis. &#8220;Find Alexis,&#8221; he
commanded.</p>

<p>Marquis understood and trotted away. Chester and Hal now arose and
walked slowly after him. At last Marquis, some distance away, set up a
loud bark. Hal and Chester approached as rapidly as their exhausted
condition would permit.</p>

<p>Marquis was standing directly over the body of the giant Cossack,
surrounded by a circle of the enemies whom Alexis had slain in
combat.</p>

<p>The giant stirred slightly as the boys approached. Quickly Hal bent
over him and, raising his head upon his knee, placed the canteen to his
lips.</p>

<p>This brought a sigh from Alexis&#8217; lips, and soon he sat up and
looked around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, waving his arm toward the circle of his
fallen foes, &#8220;you can see what a Cossack does when he
fights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Hal briefly. &#8220;But come, if you are
able to walk. We had better get away from this spot. The battle is not
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, a Cossack run!&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we stay here we shall probably be killed,&#8221;
replied Chester. &#8220;See,&#8221; pointing, &#8220;even now the
Cossacks are retreating in the face of superior numbers. We must
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8213;&#8221; began Alexis, but Hal interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said, taking him by the arm.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s move away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grumbling and protesting, the giant allowed himself to be led toward
the head of the Cossack line, now some distance back. Bullets and
shells were still whistling overhead, for the three were between the
opposing forces. None dropped near them, however, and they continued on
their way.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the German line, came the clear call of a bugle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; shouted Hal, hurrying forward. &#8220;The
Germans are going to charge. We mustn&#8217;t be caught in
between.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was too late. Even as the lad spoke, the German cavalry came
forward with a rush.</p>

<p>Hal realized in an instant that they would not have time to rejoin
the main body of Cossacks, for should the latter advance to meet the
charge, they would not do so rapidly enough to come up to them before
the Germans. Should the Cossacks retreat, the three could not possibly
hope to come up with them.</p>

<p>Fortunately the three were at the extreme east of the battle line;
so now, turning quickly, Hal led the way out of danger. When far enough
away so that there was little likelihood of being struck by stray
bullets, they halted to witness the progress of the battle.</p>

<p>The Cossacks advanced to meet the charge of the German cavalry, and
threw it back upon its infantry support, which once more issued from
the trenches. German field guns were unlimbered and hurled their shells
screeching at the Russians. The latter were forced to retreat.</p>

<p>The Germans pushed this advantage closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had infantry or artillery here,&#8221; groaned
Alexis, &#8220;there would be a different story to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of that,&#8221; replied Hal; &#8220;but to
advance in the face of such overwhelming numbers would be
foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Alexis, &#8220;but I never like to see a
Cossack run from his foes, no matter what their number.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain now that the Russian commander realized the futility of
further fighting with his vastly superior foe. The Cossacks gave way
more rapidly and finally turned and began their retreat upon Lodz.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here we are right in the middle of the Germans,&#8221;
said Chester. &#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to try to get back to our lines,&#8221; said
Hal, &#8220;and the sooner we start the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;Let&#8217;s start at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis had so far recovered now as to announce that he was feeling
&#8220;perfectly fit,&#8221; and making a slight detour, the three
friends, closely followed by Marquis, set out.</p>

<p>They had progressed possibly half a mile, when Marquis suddenly
began to growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose is the matter with him?&#8221; demanded
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;Evidently he
scents some kind of danger.&#8221; He turned to the dog. &#8220;What is
it, Marquis?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Marquis&#8217; only answer was a series of deep growls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Germans?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>Marquis uttered a short bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter,&#8221; said Hal,
quietly.</p>

<p>At that moment there came riding down a nearby road a troop of
German cavalry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! down on the ground!&#8221; cried Hal. &#8220;Perhaps
they won&#8217;t see us!&#8221;</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, and Chester and Alexis followed
his example.</p>

<p>But it was too late. The Germans had espied them and now came toward
them at a gallop. Alexis rose to his feet and stretched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another fight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Hal. &#8220;It&#8217;s
impossible. They have us. That&#8217;s all there is about it. We shall
have to submit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Germans came to a sudden halt a few feet away, and rifles were
brought to bear upon the three friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are our prisoners!&#8221; called the German
commander.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII.<br /><span
class='fss'>GERMANY&#8217;S NAPOLEON.</span></h2>

<p>Hal raised his hands in token of surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no help for it,&#8221; he said to his two friends in
an undertone.</p>

<p>The German commander motioned the three to approach. They did
so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will each climb up behind one of my men,&#8221; ordered
the German leader.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester did as ordered, but when Alexis approached one of
the German horsemen the latter eyed him dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You can&#8217;t ride with
me. You would break this horse in two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer turned to the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give your horse to the prisoner,&#8221; he commanded,
&#8220;and you climb up behind the man nearest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier did as commanded, and a moment later Alexis also was in
the saddle. Then the little troop got under way again, headed for the
German lines.</p>

<p>There was no conversation as the little troop rode along, and at
length they were well inside the German trenches. Here, after some
delay, the three prisoners were conducted before General von
Hindenburg, the Teuton commander in the East, a man of kindly face and
courteous bearing, the man whose successes, brief though they were,
earned him the name of &#8220;The German Napoleon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How comes it,&#8221; asked General von Hindenburg of Hal,
&#8220;that you two American lads are fighting with the Russians? How
comes it that two lads born and reared in a civilized country have
espoused the cause of the barbarians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; answered Hal boldly, &#8220;I do
not consider the Russians barbarians. In the next place, we joined the
Allies when the Germans ravaged Belgium.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ravaged!&#8221; exclaimed the German commander with some
heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;We joined the Belgian army
before Liège, and we hold commissions in the Belgian army. We were also
attached for a time to the British forces under Sir John French. We
bore communications from Sir John French to Grand Duke Nicholas, that
is how we happen to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you carry these dispatches, may I ask?&#8221;
inquired General von Hindenburg.</p>

<p>&#8220;By airship,&#8221; replied Hal briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the general. &#8220;You flew over Germany
in an airship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, only part of it,&#8221; replied Hal with a grin; and
seeing no harm, he told the German commander of their adventures after
being captured and taken to Berlin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are brave lads,&#8221; said the general calmly, when Hal
had finished. &#8220;I would that Germany had more like you. But I fear
your fighting days are over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do with us, General?&#8221; asked Chester, who
up to this time had remained silent, Hal usually acting as spokesman
when there was explaining to be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be sent to Posen,&#8221; replied the general,
&#8220;where you will be detained until after the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that may be for years, General,&#8221; protested Hal,
trying to draw the general out.</p>

<p>In this he was successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; replied General von Hindenburg
calmly. &#8220;The war will be over within the next six months. Germany
will have conquered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal did not reply, for he had no mind to antagonize the general; but
he had his own ideas as to the ultimate outcome of the war.</p>

<p>The general now summoned one of his staff, and turned the lads over
to the latter with this injunction:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have them sent to Posen. Instruct Commander Friech that they
must be well guarded, but treated with kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed gravely to both lads, who saluted and followed the other
officer from the German commander&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will remain in my quarters until to-night,&#8221; said
the officer to the three friends, &#8220;and you probably will start on
your journey about midnight. There is a detachment leaving about that
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He conducted the three and the dog to his tent, where their wounds
were dressed and a guard was stationed over them. Then they were left
to themselves.</p>

<p>Alexis, who up to this time had not spoken, at last opened his
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this all about?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t understand this outlandish gibberish. What&#8217;s it all
about, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation between the lads and the German officers had been
in English.</p>

<p>Chester broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Outlandish gibberish!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Why,
Alexis, if you only knew how your native tongue sounds, you
wouldn&#8217;t call anything gibberish. It&#8217;s fortunate you speak
German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps so,&#8221; Alexis agreed. &#8220;But
what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;that we are to be taken to
Posen, where we will be held prisoners till after the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis uttered a loud Russian imprecation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in hope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that when I went into
East Prussia it would be as part of an army too big for the Germans
ever to drive out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped now,&#8221; said Chester
briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been helped if you had let me fight when I
wanted to,&#8221; said the big Cossack regretfully.</p>

<p>All day long the three were kept close inside the tent. Not once
were they permitted to step into the open. Night fell, and food was
placed before them. They were almost famished, so they ate heartily,
sharing their meal with Marquis. It was well along toward midnight when
the German officer once more entered the tent and informed them it was
time for them to leave.</p>

<p>They followed the officer into the open air, where a large body of
men were ready to move. Quickly they were led to horses, and were soon
in the saddle. Then, closely guarded, they were led away at a swift
trot.</p>

<p>The German camp was some miles from the nearest railroad station,
and it took several hours to cover this distance. At last, however,
they were conducted aboard a train, where, under heavy guard, they
continued their journey.</p>

<p>It was well along toward the next evening when the train, after many
stops, finally pulled into Posen. With a number of other prisoners, the
three friends and Marquis, who had been allowed to accompany them, were
taken from the train and turned over to another squad of troops. In the
center of these they were led to a large and massive castle at one end
of the town. Here they were thrust into a dark though well-appointed
room, which, their guard informed them, was to be their prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is where we are to spend the next few years,
eh?&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;The outlook is not very bright,&#8221; replied Hal,
&#8220;but we shall have to make the best of a bad
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three began a careful survey of their prison. There were two
large windows in the room, looking out into a little court. Through
these a dim light streamed. The windows were heavily barred. Hal and
Chester tested the bars. Alexis, however, after one look, sat down in
deep disgust. If his wounds bothered him any, he did not seem to mind
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance of escape here,&#8221; said Hal, after shaking one
of the heavy iron bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; agreed Chester, after making a
test.</p>

<p>They turned from the windows just as a key grated in the lock of the
heavy door, and a man of huge stature, topping the giant frame of
Alexis by more than an inch, entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; he said politely enough. &#8220;I have
come to see if you require anything. We have been instructed to treat
you kindly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little liberty is about all,&#8221; said Hal, with a rueful
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; replied the newcomer, also smiling
slightly, &#8220;but that is the one thing I cannot grant you. I
suppose you wonder who I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said the newcomer, striking himself a hard blow on
the chest, &#8220;am Freiderich von Bernstrum, brother of Heinrich von
Bernstrum, commander of this fortress, and I am kept cooped up here
while there is fighting to be done&#8211;me, Freiderich von Bernstrum,
a real fighter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm-m-m,&#8221; muttered Hal to himself as he glanced keenly
at Alexis. &#8220;Two of a kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis moved restlessly as the big German made this boast. It was
plain to both lads that, while he might like to brag himself, he did
not relish hearing another do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued von Bernstrum, &#8220;I would go to the
front. But my brother, he would stay here. You see,&#8221; and the
talkative German leaned closer to the lads, &#8220;he has a fair
captive in the tower above, and he seeks to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is she?&#8221; demanded Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will mention no names,&#8221; replied the German.
&#8220;Enough that she is a Russian countess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis jumped to his feet and advanced upon the big German.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have dared to lay a hand upon a Russian lady?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>The German eyed him amusedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of it?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;However, you need
have no fear. She prefers me, and I shall take her away from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis raised a threatening hand, but Hal stayed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Some good may come of this
if you obey me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis subsided.</p>

<p>Hal approached Chester and whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep von Bernstrum in conversation while I have a word with
Alexis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester did as Hal ordered, and the latter whispered to the big
Cossack:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can whip this man?&#8221; pointing to von
Bernstrum.</p>

<p>Alexis&#8217; fingers twitched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember you are wounded, Alexis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, then, and do as I tell you,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>He turned again to von Bernstrum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the lady would be
pleased to know a man like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you see it?&#8221; cried the German. &#8220;But Heinrich
is so cunning. Now if I had your help&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have us do?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>The big German was silent for some minutes before replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had your help,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;I would
see that you all regained your liberty. Will you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you would have us do?&#8221; asked Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not say until you have promised,&#8221; said von
Bernstrum.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we will not promise till you have told us,&#8221; said
Hal. &#8220;How do we know that you are a man of your word, or that you
are a fighter, such as you would have us believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Freiderich von Bernstrum not a fighter!&#8221;
exclaimed the big German in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have only your word for it,&#8221; said Hal quietly.</p>

<p>Von Bernstrum paced up and down excitedly. He stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me bring swords!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;and you
shall see whether I can fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made as if to leave the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast!&#8221; exclaimed Hal. &#8220;The clash of steel
would bring the whole fortress down on us. But I shall try you
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; exclaimed the German eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis!&#8221; called Hal.</p>

<p>The big Cossack approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Hal to the German, pointing to Alexis,
&#8220;is a foeman worthy of your steel. You shall try with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed von Bernstrum. &#8220;With
fists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Hal, who was somewhat doubtful of
Alexis&#8217; prowess in the fistic art. &#8220;How about a wrestling
match?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed von Bernstrum again. &#8220;But I
assure you I am his superior.&#8221; He turned to Alexis. &#8220;Get
ready, man!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE ESCAPE.</span></h2>

<p>Alexis made ready.</p>

<p>Hal realized that he was taking a desperate chance to put through
the scheme that had entered his mind. Not only was von Bernstrum a
bigger man than Alexis, but the latter had lost much blood only 36
hours before. Doubtless also he knew every trick of a wrestler or
fighter.</p>

<p>Alexis took off his shoes and threw them into a corner, and divested
himself of his coat. Von Bernstrum growled like a dog as he followed
the Cossack&#8217;s example.</p>

<p>Alexis held out his hand. Von Bernstrum gripped it hard and gave a
grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s hand,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Alexis placed his right hand across the German&#8217;s shoulders and
caught him firmly and the boys saw by the expression on his face that
he was not certain of the outcome. The German had not boasted in vain.
He was indeed a giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever men felt the joy of battle, these two do,&#8221;
exclaimed Hal to Chester.</p>

<p>The two men were now gripped in a tight embrace. Von Bernstrum felt
Alexis over carefully, but gave him no opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s chest,&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<p>Alexis so far had uttered no word. Now he perceived that his
opponent was preparing for the loin throw and prepared himself to meet
it. When he had foiled this attack, he held his opponent for a moment
at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Alexis gripped von Bernstrum for a hug. Had the German been a weaker
man, his ribs must have cracked; but he had caught deep breath, and the
Cossack might as well have tried to crush a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good try!&#8221; muttered the German.</p>

<p>He now tested Alexis sorely. He tried a cross hitch, but failed. At
this, a smile broke out on Alexis&#8217; face.</p>

<p>Both lads, who had been watching the struggle nervously, now grew
confident. It was evident that the Cossack hoped for victory.</p>

<p>At last Alexis saw his chance. In getting the grip he wanted, it was
necessary for him to face the danger of putting himself in his
opponent&#8217;s power; but the Cossack ventured to do this, for he
realized that by no other means could he throw him. Von Bernstrum saw
his opponent&#8217;s move and took advantage of it, and for a moment
Alexis was afraid it was all over with him.</p>

<p>But he still held his ground. Von Bernstrum&#8217;s grip grew weaker
at last, and the boys could hear him panting like a dog. Hal spoke to
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he realizes that Alexis will master him,&#8221; he
exclaimed in a whisper.</p>

<p>Chester nodded in assent.</p>

<p>Now Alexis put all the strength of his mighty shoulders, back and
loins into a mighty heave, and Freiderich von Bernstrum, giant though
he was, went flying across the room, his head striking the floor with a
terrible thud.</p>

<p>For a moment the lads were afraid Alexis had killed him; but for a
moment only. Calmly Alexis put on his shoes and donned his coat. Then
he turned to his young friends and waited. His attitude said as plain
as words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done the fighting. You do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly Hal stooped over the fallen man and took a bunch of keys
from his pocket. Then, straightening up, he approached the door, opened
it and peered out. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>Hal turned to Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Change clothes with him,&#8221; he whispered, motioning to
the fallen German.</p>

<p>Hastily Alexis obeyed. In spite of the fact that von Bernstrum was
almost two inches taller than Alexis, the height of the latter was so
great that Hal believed the difference would not be noticed.</p>

<p>The lad now relieved von Bernstrum of his revolvers. Alexis had
donned his adversary&#8217;s sword with his uniform. Then once more Hal
approached the door and peered out. Then he spoke to Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go with you as though we were your prisoners,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;If anyone accosts us, we may have to fight.
However, I believe you look enough like von Bernstrum to avoid
detection. Pull the hat well over your face, and if anyone asks where
you are going, reply that you are taking the prisoners to the
commandant. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis signified that he did, and quietly the three, still followed
by Marquis, left the room. Along the same passageways they had
traversed Hal guided Alexis by a touch of the hand, for the lad&#8217;s
sense of direction was much better than that of the giant Cossack.</p>

<p>At last they came into the open and started toward the gate. So far
they had not been accosted. At the gate a soldier approached Alexis and
saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going out, sir?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the Cossack, mimicking von
Bernstrum&#8217;s voice as best he could. &#8220;These prisoners have
given me their parole, and I am taking them out for a breath of air.
Get me two more horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier saluted and turned away. Hal addressed Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing beautifully,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know you were such a strategist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Alexis, &#8220;next to being a fighter
I am a strategist. I remember one time&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save it for some other time,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe&#8213;&#8221; began the big
Cossack, somewhat crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind now,&#8221; broke in Chester. &#8220;We have other
things to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis subsided, grumbling. A few moments later the soldier
reappeared leading three horses. Alexis took all three bridles, and
bade the soldier begone, which order the latter obeyed in a hurry.</p>

<p>Quickly the three friends leaped into the saddle, and started off at
a rapid trot, riding eastward. Out of sight of the town, they bore off
slightly to the North, for, as Hal said, they did not wish to run right
into the German army advancing on Lodz.</p>

<p>They had proceeded perhaps a mile out of sight of the castle, when
Hal suddenly checked his mount, and raised a warning hand. All stopped
to listen. From the direction in which they had just come, came the
frenzied tolling of a great bell, followed by a few faint shots.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have learned of our escape,&#8221; said Hal quietly.
&#8220;That, I imagine, is a warning to the countryside to be on the
lookout for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three put spurs to their horses, and set off again at a gallop.
For two hours they kept up this swift pace, and then Alexis drew
rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless I want this horse to drop under me,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;we shall have to slow down. There is no horse living that can
carry me at that gait very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys did not doubt this, and they continued their journey at a
more leisurely pace. Finally, rounding a turn in the road, they came
upon a little stream, perhaps a hundred yards wide. There was no
bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we shall have to make our horses swim it,&#8221; said
Chester.</p>

<p>Accordingly all plunged into the stream, Marquis swimming behind,
and soon reached the opposite shore. Here they drew up in a clump of
bushes and sat down to dry off a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they know which way we came?&#8221; asked Hal
of Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. However, I suppose they will search in
all directions, and they are bound to come upon us sooner or later if
we linger around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right. I guess we had better move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon the little party was in the saddle again, and making off at a
rapid trot. Hal, for some unaccountable reason turning suddenly in his
saddle, uttered an ejaculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Hal, pointing back toward the little
stream.</p>

<p>Alexis and Chester followed the direction of Hal&#8217;s finger.
Just plunging into the stream were half a dozen horsemen, and it was
plain from that distance that they were German soldiers, and that they
had made out the forms of the fugitives.</p>

<p>The three friends put spurs to their horses and, with Marquis loping
along behind, soon lost themselves in a little woods. Here they urged
their tired horses on, and at last came to a small open space. This
they crossed before Alexis&#8217; horse gave out and went to the ground
in a heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it&#8217;s all off,&#8221; exclaimed Hal.
&#8220;How far do you suppose we are from the German border,
Alexis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not far,&#8221; answered the Cossack. &#8220;Besides, some of
our troops have been operating in these parts. They were only small
detachments, and most of them have been driven off; but even now there
may be some of them near.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis urged the two lads to ride on and leave him, but this they
refused to do. Therefore they dismounted and, turning their horses
loose, they continued their journey on foot.</p>

<p>As they walked along a man suddenly popped out from among the trees,
brought his revolver to bear upon the trio, and in a loud tone
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis gave one quick glance at the man&#8217;s uniform, uttered a
cry of pleasure and spoke a few quick words in his native tongue. The
lads were surprised to see the man drop his rifle, throw his arms about
Alexis and embrace him.</p>

<p>For some moments after quitting this embrace the two talked in
Russian, the lads being able to pick up only a few words. Then Alexis
turned to the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;He belongs to a
detachment of Cossacks who raided in these parts two weeks ago. The
detachment was surrounded by Germans, he tells me, and practically
annihilated. About 150 men escaped to the woods, where they have been
conducting a guerilla warfare, picking off the Germans one at a time,
wherever they happen to find one alone, or in pairs, or small parties.
These Cossacks are scattered all through the woods, and to get them
together would be almost impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how are they able to tell friend from foe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that large green leaf my brother wears in his
hat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is their emblem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis&#8217; brother approached and spoke in German.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall show you
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way into the woods, and approached a large tree, where he
pointed to a placard tacked on it. The placard read:</p>

<p>&#8220;All Russians at large in these woods are ordered to assemble
at this spot the 10th of this month without arms and surrender, under
penalty of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was posted two weeks ago,&#8221; said Alexis&#8217;
brother, &#8220;and this is the 20th. Read our answer below
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and take us!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX.<br /><span
class='fss'>GUERILLA WARFARE.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean?&#8221; asked Hal, &#8220;that 150 men, at large
in these woods, have defied the whole German army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are less than a hundred now,&#8221; replied the brother
of Alexis, whose name the lads learned was Stephan. &#8220;We have been
conducting this guerilla warfare for more than two weeks now, and we
have done inestimable harm to the Germans. We have evaded large bodies
of troops sent out to kill or capture us. Of course, some of our men
have been picked off, but we are not going to run yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you live?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been living on roots and herbs,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;and such other food as we have been able to take from the
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where do you sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This forest,&#8221; said Stephan, &#8220;makes an ideal
hiding place. It is filled with large caves, the presence of which
seems to be unknown to the foe. Many of the caves are large enough for
twenty men, although it is seldom that there are more than five or six
men in one at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the rear came the sound of galloping horses. Stephan sprang to
instant action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he cried, and led the way into the very
thick of the forest.</p>

<p>Hal, Chester, Alexis and Marquis followed him and soon were safe
from discovery in a large cave, the mouth of which was screened from
view by a dense mass of shrubbery.</p>

<p>Outside, after a few minutes, the lads could hear the sounds of
moving horses and the exclamations of their riders. The horsemen halted
near the entrance to the cave and held a consultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have probably fallen in with some of these
guerillas,&#8221; said one voice. &#8220;If so, we shall have hard work
to find them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Close upon his words came a scream from outside, and straining their
ears, the party inside made out the sound of a distant pistol shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;One more gone,&#8221; said Stephan briefly.</p>

<p>There came a volley from outside the cave, as the Germans fired at
their unseen assailant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much chance of their hitting anybody,&#8221; said Stephan
calmly.</p>

<p>From outside the cave came the sound of rapidly retreating
hoofbeats. The Germans were moving away. Alexis, having thus quickly
learned the way of the guerillas, cautiously poked his head from the
cave, reached back and picked up his brother&#8217;s rifle, and fired
after the retreating foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another one,&#8221; he said grimly, returning the weapon to
Stephan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just how long do you suppose you can keep this work
up?&#8221; Chester asked of Stephan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much longer, I am afraid,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I
figure it is only a question of days now until the Germans send out a
force strong enough to search the woods thoroughly. In that event, we
shall try to make our way back over the border to safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a corner of the cave Stephan now produced a small quantity of
food, which he set out. All fell to and it was soon disposed of. Then
they ventured from the cave and, walking slowly, made their way
northward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a case of keep moving,&#8221; Stephan
explained. &#8220;Of course, it might be possible for us to join
forces, but then we should greatly lessen our effectiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis, who was in front, stopped suddenly and threw up a warning
hand. Immediately the other three halted in their tracks. Peering in
the direction in which Alexis pointed, they made out the forms of half
a dozen German soldiers standing near a tree. Directly, however, the
latter made off, and the little party approached the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another placard, eh?&#8221; muttered Stephan, as he drew
near.</p>

<p>The other three also approached and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;The time for surrender has been extended till to-morrow at
noon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Angrily, Stephan snatched the placard from the tree. Turning, he saw
several other trees also bearing placards. These he also tore down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender, eh!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he clapped his hand to his side and staggered back. At the
same instant, from directly ahead, came the sharp crack of a rifle. But
Stephan did not fall. Recovering himself, he dashed straight in the
direction of the shot at top speed. There came the second crack of a
rifle, but still the Cossack did not pause.</p>

<p>Now Hal, and Chester, dashing after him with Alexis at their side,
saw Stephan pause momentarily, raise his rifle and fire quickly twice.
Then he dropped to the ground. But it was not from injury, as the
others feared, for at that moment there came a volley and bullets
whistled overhead. Quickly Hal, Chester and Alexis also flung
themselves to the earth.</p>

<p>Stephan, lying upon his stomach, was pumping lead steadily straight
before him. Hal, Chester and Alexis drew their revolvers and joined in
the fray. Through the trees they could now make out the number of their
assailants. There were an even dozen of them, all lying in a little
clearing, their rifles trained upon the spot where the four friends
lay.</p>

<p>Under the deadly aim of Stephan&#8217;s rifle, two men dropped to
the ground. The others returned the Cossack&#8217;s fire, but the
latter was well protected by foliage, and escaped injury. Another
German jumped to his feet, spun round on his heel, and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then, at a word from one of the Germans, the remaining nine jumped
suddenly to their feet and dashed toward their enemies on a dead run,
their rifles spitting fire as they came on. Exposed to the fire of the
foe as they were, they realized that their only chance of life lay in
rushing their opponents.</p>

<p>Alexis was the first to see the danger in this attack. He jumped to
his feet, dragging Hal and Chester with him. Stephan also was up in an
instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; cried Alexis, and at a rapid run, he urged the
lads to another secluded spot.</p>

<p>There, as the Germans appeared in the spot where they had stood a
few moments before, Stephan, the only one of the four armed with a
rifle, fired three more quick shots at the foe. One tumbled forward on
his face, and a second dropped his rifle.</p>

<p>And now unexpected aid came to the four friends. From the rear of
the Germans came several rifle shots in quick succession, and two more
of the enemy bit the dust. As they turned to face this new attack,
Stephan stepped forward and opened on them again. Caught thus between
two fires, the Germans fought well, firing blindly at their unseen foes
on both sides.</p>

<p>But such a struggle could have but one ending. The Cossacks,
screened from the fire of the enemy who lay between them, were
practically safe from the German fire, at the same time having the
Germans at their mercy. No quarter was asked, nor none was given. Soon
a heap of fallen bodies marked the spot where the Germans had made
their last stand.</p>

<p>From the other side of the Germans, two Cossacks now stepped forth,
and approached. Stephan advanced to meet them. Alexis made his way to
the fallen foe, and gathered up the rifles. Returning, he passed one to
each lad, with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here; these beat revolvers for this kind of
warfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a short conference with the two newcomers, Stephan motioned
for his friends to follow, and the party, now increased to six, moved
on. For perhaps half an hour they marched through the woods, and at the
end of that time stopped once more before the entrance to a second
cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we enter,&#8221; said Stephan, &#8220;I will tell you
that these men have just informed me that inside a consultation of war
is being held. There are perhaps 60 men there, who have gathered here
for that purpose. I have vouched for you, and you will therefore be
admitted to the consultation without question.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others signified that they understood, and Stephan led the way
into the cave. Inside, the lads looked quickly around. This cave, they
saw, was much greater than the first they had entered. Also it showed
signs of human handiwork. Large pillars ran up through the center of
it, and beyond the far entrance the lads could see one, then two more
compartments.</p>

<p>Sitting about on the floor of the first compartment were more than
half a hundred men, talking in low tones. They looked up in surprise at
the sight of Hal and Chester, but Alexis they greeted with a nod. The
latter stepped forward and greeted them in their native tongue. The
lads could not make out all he said, but the looks of suspicion on the
faces of some vanished immediately, and they moved a bit to let the
newcomers join the circle.</p>

<p>Plainly it was the opinion of most of the men that the guerilla
warfare had been carried far enough. Some were in favor of making a
last desperate raid upon the enemy before attempting to get back across
the Russian border, while others were in favor of attempting to get
back immediately.</p>

<p>For an hour the discussion waged and then it was rudely interrupted.
The man left to guard the entrance to the cavern rushed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Germans approaching in great force!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Immediately all were on their feet, and one man rushed to the narrow
entrance. He started through but fell back, a bullet in his head. A
second, rifle in hand, also advanced, but Hal, springing quickly to his
feet, stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They can pick us off one at a
time as we go out. Some other plan will have to be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephan and Alexis took their stand by the lad&#8217;s side, and
faced the men who would have rushed to certain death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lad is right,&#8221; said Stephan. &#8220;Out the other
end of the cave, men, and scatter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rapidly this order was obeyed, and soon none were left in the first
compartment but Hal, Chester, Alexis, Stephan and Marquis.</p>

<p>Now Hal also dashed after the others. But the lad was not bent upon
flight, leaving his friends to face the enemy alone. Quickly he hurried
through the three compartments of the cavern, casting a keen eye here
and there. Clear to the far entrance he went, and then turned back. As
he made his way along, he stumbled over something and fell heavily. He
was up in a moment, however, and glanced curiously at the object over
which he had tripped. Then a smile lighted up his face. He made his way
back to his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many do you suppose there are out there?&#8221; asked
Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no means of telling,&#8221; replied Chester.
&#8220;However, there are probably no less than two or three
hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we stand here and fire as they attempt to enter, we may
have some success,&#8221; said Stephan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Alexis, &#8220;but the detonations may
occasion the falling in of the cavern. At the first shot from outside a
piece of falling rock grazed my shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must do something quickly,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;We
cannot leave without striking at least one blow at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly not,&#8221; agreed Alexis. &#8220;I have a
plan.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE MIGHT OF ALEXIS.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded all eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will retreat to the second compartment,&#8221; said the
giant, &#8220;and I will place myself behind the pillar, which I can
see from here.&#8221; He stooped and picked up a long heavy iron bar
from the ground. &#8220;I will have this for my weapon, and invisible
in the darkness, if they come in a rush, I can let my bar fall upon
their skulls thirty times a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Hal, &#8220;and at the same time I have
another plan. The rest of us shall retreat to the third compartment,
leaving Alexis, for the moment, to deal with the foe alone. But Alexis,
when I say retreat, you must leave your post and come to the third
compartment. Is it agreed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed!&#8221; cried the giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then. To your post!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly the four retreated to the second compartment, where Alexis
took up his post behind the large pillar, concealed from view by the
narrowness of the entrance between the compartments themselves. The
others retreated to the third compartment.</p>

<p>For a long time, it seemed to Alexis, he waited in silence. Then the
head of a man appeared through the entrance to his compartment and came
toward him. There were more heads behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike, Alexis!&#8221; came Hal&#8217;s voice from the next
compartment.</p>

<p>The giant obeyed. The iron bar rose and fell full upon the head of
the first man, who dropped without a cry. Ten times in almost as many
seconds the huge iron bar rose and fell again and not once did it fail
to find its mark.</p>

<p>The German soldiers could see nothing; they heard sighs and groans;
they stumbled over dead bodies, but as they did not realize the cause
of all this, they still came forward. So far there had not been a sound
to tell those behind what was transpiring in front.</p>

<p>But now an officer, bearing a torch, approached. On arriving at the
entrance to the compartment where Alexis had exterminated all that had
come, he drew back in terror; but his retreat was blocked by those
pressing on from behind. The officer saw the heap of dead, but as yet
he had not discerned the cause.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gigantic hand issued from nowhere and clutched him by the
throat. A second later the captain fell close to the now extinguished
torch, adding another body to the heap of dead. All this was effected
as mysteriously as if by magic. Another officer, unable to account for
the pile of dead, cried to the men behind him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>A volley rang out, and for a moment the cavern was lighted as if by
day. But none was hit. From behind him Alexis now heard the sound of
Hal&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back quickly!&#8221; whispered the lad.</p>

<p>The giant obeyed instantly, and glided softly through the door to
the third compartment. Hal took him by the arm and led him to the side
of the room, where he showed him the object over which he had stumbled
when in the compartment a few moments before. It was a barrel of
powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;you will take this barrel,
the fuse of which I am going to light, and hurl it at our enemy. Can
you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis stooped over the barrel, weighing fully seventy pounds. He
lifted it easily with one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light it,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw it right in among them,&#8221; explained Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light it,&#8221; repeated Alexis.</p>

<p>Hal did so, and the giant, picking up the barrel, advanced to the
door of the compartment. Beyond he could hear the confused shouts of
many men, as they in vain sought to explain the death of their
companions.</p>

<p>Alexis blew on the fuse, that it might burn quicker.</p>

<p>And now, by the light of the sparkling fuse, the enemy made out his
form. They saw the barrel he held in his hand; they understood what was
going to happen.</p>

<p>A cry of terror arose. Some attempted to fly; officers cried out to
Alexis that they would spare him if he would extinguish the fuse.
Others commanded their men to fire; but the latter were too terrified
to do so.</p>

<p>Now the arm of the giant swung round. There passed through the air
the train of fire, like a falling star. The barrel fell into the midst
of the terrified German soldiers. Immediately Alexis dashed for the far
end of the cavern, just outside which his friends now stood.</p>

<p>Then, from inside the second compartment came the terrible thunder
of the explosion, blowing the cavern to pieces, hurling men to death by
the force of its shock, falling stones crushing out the life of many
more.</p>

<p>Alexis dashed for the open air, where his friends stood awaiting
him, a happy smile on his face at the success of his exploit. Three
more paces and he would be free of the cavern&#8211;two more. And right
at the exit, a heavy piece of rock, sent hurling in the air by the
explosion, fell upon him&#8211;striking him upon the
shoulder&#8211;bearing him to the ground&#8211;pinioning him beneath
it.</p>

<p>And at the same instant the walls of the cavern began to give.
Chester, realizing what was happening, sprang into the mouth of the
cave, closely followed by Hal and Stephan. Now, under the massive rock,
Alexis stirred. In spite of the great weight upon him, he turned slowly
under it, until it rested squarely upon his back. Then stretching his
hands out before him, he rose to his knees balancing the rock upon his
back. Then he straightened up, and the rock tumbled from him with a
terrible crash. He turned, and with his friends, dashed from the
cave.</p>

<p>They had not escaped a second too soon.</p>

<p>There was a terrible rending sound, the crunching of rock against
rock, and slowly the walls of the cavern gave; then fell inward with a
fearful crash.</p>

<p>Some distance from the cavern the four stopped running. Hal wiped
the moisture from his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;A close call and no mistake,&#8221; he said weakly.</p>

<p>Chester grasped Alexis by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were done for,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Alexis grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t kill me that way,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What&#8217;s a little rock like that? It was play for me to lift
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; replied Chester, &#8220;but even now, I can
scarcely believe what I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Alexis, &#8220;I could have lifted that rock
with one hand. It was child&#8217;s play. Now I can still remember one
great feat I accomplished. It was in St. Petersburg&#8211;Petrograd
now, by the grace of God and the Czar. There is a little stream runs
through the city. Over this there is a bridge. I was passing along one
day, when I saw that the bridge, having been weakened in the middle,
was about to fall. Well, there was no one on it, so that would have
been all right. But, dashing down the street was an ambulance. The
woman in it was very ill. It was absolutely necessary that she be taken
across the bridge at once. At the bridge the driver was held up. The
guard would not allow the ambulance to cross. It was too dangerous. But
delay meant death for the lady. I leaped into a small boat and was
quickly under the middle of the bridge. The bridge was low, and by
standing I could just touch it. I put my two hands under the bridge and
braced it while the ambulance crossed. I was sorely tested, but I held
out. I account that one of my greatest feats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you should,&#8221; said Hal dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; demanded Stephan, who was greatly interested in
his brother&#8217;s wonderful narrative, &#8220;how is it, that with
all that weight resting upon you, and you standing in a boat, the boat
didn&#8217;t sink? I can&#8217;t understand how, with that weight upon
it, it remained afloat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Alexis with perfect gravity, &#8220;I forgot
to mention that the stream was very shallow&#8211;in fact it could be
waded. The boat was forced down by the great weight until it rested on
the bottom. In that way, it was perfectly simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; exclaimed Stephan. &#8220;A wonderful feat,
truly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was the bridge made out of rubber?&#8221; asked Chester,
laughing to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubber?&#8221; repeated Alexis. &#8220;No; it was a wooden
bridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;how do you account for the
fact that it stretched so when the boat went to the bottom of the
stream?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it stretched,&#8221; said Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t say so,&#8221; grinned Chester;
&#8220;but it must have stretched unless it broke in two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis looked aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe me&#8213;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dispute you for the world,&#8221; said
Chester. &#8220;I just wondered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis would have replied, but at that instant his hat was lifted
from his head, and all four became aware of the distant sound of a
shot. Quickly all dropped to the ground, but they were not quick enough
to go unscathed. A bullet struck Stephan in the arm, and he dropped it
to his side with a cry.</p>

<p>Instantly Alexis was all anxiety. He jumped to his brother&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you much hurt, Stephan?&#8221; he asked tenderly, taking
the injured arm in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a scratch,&#8221; replied Stephan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless Alexis would not rest until he had bound up the wound
with his handkerchief. In the meantime, from their positions on the
ground, the others had been popping away at the enemy. Several rounds
of shots were exchanged but none of the four friends was hit again. The
enemy was so far away that the lads could not tell whether or not their
fire was effective.</p>

<p>Bullets began to drop closely about them, in their exposed position.
Also they fell oftener now, indicating that the force opposed to them
was numerically superior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; exclaimed Hal, as his hat seemed to leap
suddenly from his head. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get away from here.
This is too close for comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;Now when I say the word
we&#8217;ll all jump to our feet and make a dash for those trees in the
distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the word, the four sprang to their feet, and not even waiting to
take a parting shot at the enemy, dashed away as fast as their feet
would carry them. Hal took the lead, and behind him came Stephan, then
Alexis and then Chester.</p>

<p>When Hal reached the trees, uninjured, he turned to speak to
Chester. What was his amazement and dismay to find that Chester was not
there. At that moment Alexis and Stephan dashed into the shelter. Hal
glanced back over the distance they had come.</p>

<p>There lay Chester, in the open field. He had been struck down by a
German bullet, and even now the enemy, with a triumphant cry, was
charging down upon him. With a cry, Hal leaped forward, but the iron
hand of Alexis stayed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here,&#8221; said the giant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Discarding his rifle, he dashed forward in the very face of the
onrushing foe. Chester&#8217;s life hung in the balance!</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI.<br /><span
class='fss'>TWO TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>As friend and foe alike bore down on him, Hal saw Chester raise
himself. He got to his knees, struggled to his feet, staggered, and
then fell back again.</p>

<p>The Germans rushing toward the lad numbered twenty&#8211;Hal counted
them. They were approaching the prostrate form of the lad as rapidly as
they could, afoot. But Alexis was nearer, and it was evident that he
would reach the lad first.</p>

<p>The giant Cossack covered the intervening space with long bounds,
going at a speed of which Hal had not deemed him capable.</p>

<p>And now, as he came close to Chester, a second form bounded after
him. There was a flash of a hairy body as Marquis leaped forward and
set out after Alexis. He came up with the latter before he reached
Chester, and they came to the lad&#8217;s body together.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hal and Stephan kept up a steady fire with their
rifles, pouring a hail of bullets in the direction of the advancing
Germans. One man fell, but the others dashed on.</p>

<p>At this point Hal made a startling discovery. The magazine of his
weapon was empty and he had not another cartridge. At the same moment
Stephan fired his last remaining shot. Hal sprang forward and seized
the weapon Alexis had thrown down when he dashed to Chester&#8217;s
aid. It was empty. The lad uttered a cry of dismay, and turned his
eyes. The two still had their revolvers, but the distance was too great
for a pistol bullet.</p>

<p>Alexis, having reached Chester&#8217;s side, knelt and raised the
lad&#8217;s head to his knee. Hurriedly he drew his canteen and poured
a little water down his throat. Chester looked up into the
Cossack&#8217;s face and smiled feebly. Alexis tried to place him upon
his feet, but the lad was too weak to stand.</p>

<p>A fierce growl from Marquis, who had been standing guard over the
two, with bared fangs and bristling back, called Alexis to more serious
work. The Germans, apparently fearing nothing at the hands of one man,
a wounded boy and a dog, had come within fifty feet without firing a
shot at the trio. Now, as they approached closer, the leader of the
band called out: &#8220;You are my prisoners!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting to reply, Alexis leaped toward them. His sword
flashed from his scabbard and whirled aloft even as he jumped. He was
among the enemy before they realized what had happened.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the giant&#8217;s spring stood him in good stead.
Before a rifle or a revolver could be brought to bear on the huge form,
Alexis had come to such close quarters with his foes as to prevent the
use of firearms. The German leader did draw his revolver, but the mêlée
was so fierce and men were tangled up so that he was unable to fire for
fear of hitting one of his own men.</p>

<p>To the right, to the left, and straight ahead darted the fiery sword
of the giant Cossack. The Germans gave back before the very savageness
of this attack, but Alexis kept close in among them, for while he was
fighting mad, he was still cool enough to realize that his hope of life
lay in his keeping in the center of the enemy.</p>

<p>Before the thrust of the angry sword three men fell. The blades of
the others who encircled him hissed above his head, flashed by his
side, but his single weapon so far had formed a perfect barrier. Not a
thrust or a slash had passed it. Ten swords clashed against the
giant&#8217;s blade at once. With a quick move, he swept them all
aside, and with a quick thrust disposed of another of the enemy.</p>

<p>With a rapid spring forward he avoided the weapons that would have
been buried in his back by his foes in the rear, and sweeping his sword
around his head with such rapidity that he seemed a circle of fire, for
a moment he cleared a space around him.</p>

<p>But in that instant the German officer brought his revolver to bear
and fired.</p>

<p>Alexis had perceived this move out of the tail of his eye and,
leaping straight forward into the midst of the foe once more, escaped
the bullet.</p>

<p>Whirling his sword about his head, the Cossack spun on his heel. The
guard of the German soldiers was not strong enough to ward off this
terrible blow. Two swords went spinning in the air, and Alexis&#8217;
weapon, sweeping through one of the enemy, also cut down another. But
again the Cossack had left an opening for the officer&#8217;s pistol,
and the latter was not slow to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Slowly he raised his weapon and took careful aim. He had determined
not to miss this time. His finger tightened on the trigger,
and&#8213;</p>

<p>Aid came from an unexpected source.</p>

<p>Marquis, who, up to this instant, had remained alert over Chester,
had not taken a hand in the battle. His eyes fastened at this moment on
the German officer, his canine intelligence told him as clearly as
words that his giant friend stood at death&#8217;s door. With one
fierce growl, he sprang from Chester&#8217;s side, and leaped upon the
German officer from behind, even as the latter pressed the trigger. The
officer&#8217;s aim had been deflected, and the bullet passed over
Alexis&#8217; head.</p>

<p>The German turned upon this new assailant with an imprecation. His
hand went to his holster in an attempt to draw his second revolver. But
Marquis was prepared for this move. His teeth met in the
officer&#8217;s hand and the latter yelled with pain.</p>

<p>Marquis released his hold and sprang straight at his enemy&#8217;s
throat. The latter was thrown from his feet by the force of this
attack, and in falling his head came in contact with the sharp barrel
of his revolver, knocking him unconscious.</p>

<p>Marquis, now having entered the battle, had no thought of leaving
Alexis to fight it out alone. Once in the fight, he was there to stay.
He sprang forward and leaped upon a German soldier who at that moment
would have plunged his sword into Alexis&#8217; defenseless back. The
man gave a choking cry as the teeth of the dog found lodgment in the
back of his neck and he was borne to the ground.</p>

<p>And still the giant Cossack, with herculean strength and
unbelievable prowess, was fighting his assailants. A sword had pierced
him through the left hand, another had scratched his cheek and a third
had struck him in the right shoulder. But still, unmindful of these
wounds, he fought on with the same determination and courage as
before.</p>

<p>Marquis, having dragged the man off his back, Alexis plunged into
the midst of his enemies anew. Two more were pierced through and
through by the quick and mighty thrusts of the powerful arm. Another
dropped with a bleeding head, as Alexis caught him squarely with a
quick back-handed blow just in time to avoid the point of the
other&#8217;s weapon.</p>

<p>Now there were but eight Germans left, and these leaped quickly
backward, thinking to put enough distance between them to allow them to
draw the revolvers. But Alexis gave them no time for this. Springing
after them as they turned to flee, he cut two more down with mighty
strokes. Then the others scattered. The Cossack sprang after one and
disposed of him before he could draw his pistol, but the others now had
had time to get their guns.</p>

<p>A bullet struck Alexis in the right shoulder, but he did not even
stagger. He rushed quickly upon one of his enemies, who stood with a
revolver pointed squarely at him, his finger on the trigger. There was
a sharp report, followed instantly by another and the German fell to
the ground with a bullet in his head. Alexis sprang out of the cloud of
smoke unharmed.</p>

<p>This time the Cossack had been saved from death by the hand of
Chester. The lad having recovered sufficiently to take in the scene
about him, had staggered to his feet, thinking to go to the aid of his
companion. But he was so weak he could not stand. Then, seeing the
revolver dropped by the German officer, he had crawled toward it. At
last he reached it, and he had just time to aim and fire before the man
who had drawn a bead on Alexis could pull the trigger.</p>

<p>There remained but four Germans on their feet, and these, having
witnessed the mighty prowess of the giant Cossack, turned to flee. But
Alexis was after them in a flash. His blood was up, and though bleeding
in a dozen different places, he had no mind to quit the battle until
the last of his enemies had been laid low.</p>

<p>But the fleeing Germans, unfortunately for them, had turned their
faces in the wrong direction. Hal and Stephan, who had been struck
spellbound by the terrible fighting of their friend and brother, saw
the four men coming toward them, weapons in hand, with Alexis in hot
pursuit. Quickly they aimed and fired. At this distance a miss was
impossible. Two Germans staggered in their stride, reeled, and dropped
over backward.</p>

<p>The others halted, appalled by the forgotten presence of this new
enemy. The stop was unfortunate for them. Alexis bore down on them like
an avenger, and close on his heels came Marquis. The Germans hesitated,
then started to run. It was too late.</p>

<p>Alexis&#8217; mighty sword cut down one before he had taken a dozen
steps. The other, bewildered, and not knowing which way to turn, threw
down his weapons and raised his hands in token of surrender.</p>

<p>Alexis, however, did not perceive this move. The light of battle
still flashed in his eyes, and he could see nothing but glittering
swords and shining revolver muzzles. His upraised sword would have
split the head of the German, had not Hal, stepping forward quickly,
caught the blow upon his own weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis!&#8221; he cried sharply.</p>

<p>The giant paused and looked around as one in a dream. Then he slowly
raised his sword, gazed at the lad blankly for a few seconds, spun
twice around and fell forward on his face. He had swooned.</p>

<p>Stephan leaped forward, and from his canteen poured water over the
face of his brother. Knowing that the giant was in good hands, Hal
dashed forward to where Chester still lay, having fallen back after
firing the one shot. The prisoner, now unguarded, took to his heels and
was soon out of range.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you badly hurt, Chester?&#8221; asked Hal, anxiously,
bending over his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel pretty weak,&#8221; was Chester&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe I am seriously hurt. A bullet must
have grazed my temple, and the force of the shock put me out. But say!
Isn&#8217;t Alexis a terrible fighter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say he is,&#8221; answered Hal. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe anyone ever saw such fighting before. Certainly not since the
days of Hereward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal assisted Chester to his feet and, supporting him by an
encircling arm, led the way to where even now Alexis, having received
first aid treatment at the hands of his brother, was sitting up and
gazing about somewhat vacantly.</p>

<p>Chester spoke to the big Cossack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe my life to you,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;I shall
never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied Alexis. &#8220;I
remember now. It was quite a fight, wasn&#8217;t it? But I remember
once when I was attacked by&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice died away, and he sank to the ground again.</p>

<p>His friends bent over him anxiously, and Hal placed a hand over his
heart. It was beating regularly while his deep and regular breathing
proclaimed his condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is sleeping,&#8221; said Hal quietly.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII.<br /><span
class='fss'>ON THE VISTULA.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;How far are we from the Vistula now, Alexis?&#8221; asked
Chester, as the little party rode rapidly forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than seven or eight versts, I am sure,&#8221; was
the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it likely the Germans have advanced that far in this
section?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no telling; we shall have to be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day long the four friends had been hurrying toward the Russian
lines. Alexis, after his terrible struggle with overwhelming odds, when
he had dashed forward to save Chester, had slept for hours without
moving-all night, practically. When he awoke, shortly before dawn, he
announced that he was in condition to move on.</p>

<p>Chester&#8217;s wound also had benefited by the rest and now
bothered him little. While Alexis and Chester slept, Hal and Stephan
had succeeded in capturing four horses; and so, long before sunrise,
the little party continued their flight, Marquis, as usual, trailing
along behind.</p>

<p>For another hour now the four rode on, and then a welcome sight
confronted them. Hal was the first to perceive water ahead, and called
the attention of the others to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vistula,&#8221; said Alexis briefly.</p>

<p>There was not the sign of either friend or foe. For some
unaccountable reason neither bank of the stream was guarded. Hal
supplied an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Germans have probably been pushed back further to the
South,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;thereby doing away with the
necessity of a patrol here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drew nearer the river. At this point the stream was very deep,
and there was no bridge; but as the four drew up on the bank, Chester
made out a cloud of smoke coming up the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;A steamer!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The lad was right. The smoke drew nearer, and at last the friends
were able to discern the outline of a small river vessel steaming
toward them. They jumped from their horses, and advanced to the very
edge of the water, where they awaited the approaching boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;She may be a German,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hardly likely,&#8221; said Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I understood the Germans had fitted out several river
steamers,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; replied Alexis; &#8220;I had forgotten. We shall
have to be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now the vessel was close enough for those on shore to make out
her flag. The emblem flying aloft was that of the Czar. Hal drew off
his coat and waved it about his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they will stop and pick us up,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;it may save us a tedious ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sharp blast of the whistle signified that Hal&#8217;s signal had
been seen. The steamer came to a stop in midstream, a launch put off
toward the shore, and soon grounded at the spot where the four friends
stood.</p>

<p>Quickly they leaped into the little craft and were soon aboard the
steamer, where they were greeted by the commander of the vessel. Hal
explained their situation as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the commander, &#8220;I can&#8217;t promise
to put you ashore immediately, for I am bound further up the river in
pursuit of a German steamer that has been bombarding several upstream
towns. When I have disposed of the enemy, however, I shall be glad to
land you down the stream, for I shall return immediately I have sunk
the foe.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the fugitives had to be content. They were assigned
quarters on the steamer, and after washing the dirt and grime from
their hands and faces, they returned on deck, where they made
themselves comfortable as the steamer continued on her way. They passed
several little towns without stopping.</p>

<p>Suddenly those on deck were brought to their feet by the booming of
a single heavy gun. All strained their ears to listen. The first report
was followed by the sound of others. The commander of the vessel sprang
to action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full speed ahead!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The steamer leaped forward faster than before. The crew prepared for
action. The guns were made ready and the crews stood to their posts.
The commander, from his position, motioned the four friends toward
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have run the enemy down,&#8221; he informed them.
&#8220;Can I count upon your services if they are needed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may,&#8221; replied Hal and Chester briefly.</p>

<p>Alexis and Stephan nodded their heads in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the commander. &#8220;You will stay here
near me, then. I shall not hesitate to call upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rounding a slight bend in the river, the Russian steamer came in
full sight of the enemy. So silently had she approached, that the
Germans, engaged in hurling shells upon a little village, did not
perceive their presence until a shell from the Russian plowed up the
water under the prow of their boat.</p>

<p>As soon as the Germans became aware of the presence of another enemy
they turned to meet it. Their forward guns were quickly trained upon
the Russian steamer and burst into action. The first salvo was
harmless, for the range had not been gauged accurately.</p>

<p>The Russians were more fortunate with their second fire. A shell
burst squarely upon the deck of the German with a loud explosion. There
was a shower of steel and wood, followed by a cry of triumph from the
crew of the Russian vessel. A second shell carried away the
enemy&#8217;s single smokestack and a third burst in the muzzle of one
of the foe&#8217;s forward guns, blowing it to atoms.</p>

<p>At full speed the Russian advanced, and when within two hundred
yards swung her broadside to the enemy and poured in a rain of shells.
The Germans fought back gamely, but with the first success of the
Russians they seemed to have lost their heads and fired wildly. Their
aim was poor, and the Russians suffered little.</p>

<p>Having delivered his broadside, the Russian brought his forward guns
to bear and with these he raked the deck of the enemy&#8211;fore and
aft&#8211;with shot and shell.</p>

<p>All this time the vessels had been drawing closer together. Now the
German commander, apparently realizing that he was fighting a losing
battle, steamed full speed for the Russian ship. By a hasty maneuver
the Russian commander avoided being run down, but a second later the
vessels crashed broadside to broadside.</p>

<p>The German vessel stood somewhat higher in the water than did the
Russian craft, and before any aboard the latter realized what was
happening, the foe swarmed down the side onto the Russian vessel. So
sudden and unexpected was their onslaught, that for the moment the
Russians on deck gave way before them; and had it not been for the
presence of mind of Hal and Chester, it is likely the German rush would
have been successful.</p>

<p>The two lads sprang forward into the very faces of the enemy, their
automatics spitting fire as they leaped. Alexis and Stephan came close
behind them. The very fury of their attack caused the Germans to halt
momentarily, and this gave the Russian sailors time to rally and spring
to their aid.</p>

<p>Their automatics having been emptied, the lads leaped into the thick
of their foe, striking out with their naked fists. Hal twisted a sword
from the hand of a German officer, and laid about him lustily. Chester,
stooping, came to his feet with a sword in his hand, and joined his
friend in the press. Alexis also possessed himself of a weapon and
rushed forward.</p>

<p>By this time the Russian sailors had met the foe and the conflict
became general. Slowly the Germans gave way, retreating to the side of
the ship. Then, suddenly, they turned and leaped for their own vessel,
which still lay close, under the guiding hand of the German commander.
The Russians plunged after them, following them to the deck of the
German ship.</p>

<p>Brought to bay, the Germans turned in a last desperate stand.
Releasing the helm, the German commander himself sprang into the midst
of the struggle. His sword flashed aloft, and two Russian sailors hit
the deck, pierced through and through. He was a big man, this German
commander, and a powerful one. As he pressed fiercely forward, for a
moment the first line of Russians gave way; but at that moment he ran
against a solid obstruction in the form of Alexis.</p>

<p>They fell to, hand to hand, and on all sides of them the others gave
way. Thrusting and parrying, the two skipped forward and back, each
losing ground and then recovering it. Alexis, by a quick sidestep,
avoided a fierce thrust, and stepped forward to put an end to the
encounter. In his haste he slipped, and slid to the deck.</p>

<p>With a fierce, guttural cry of satisfaction, the German stepped
forward, raised his sword and would have plunged it into his
opponent&#8217;s breast; but Alexis was too quick for him. With his
bare hand he seized the naked blade aimed at him and clung to it. In
vain did the German try to draw his sword through the Cossack&#8217;s
hand. Alexis&#8217; mighty grip held it easily.</p>

<p>Now, putting forth greater exertion, by the aid of the weapon to
which he clung, Alexis dragged himself to his feet. In vain did the
German commander wrench at the sword. He could not free it. He at
length gave up the idea, dropped the sword and leaped back.</p>

<p>As Alexis, now firm upon his feet once more, took a step forward,
the German commander turned and ran toward a rack of rifles. Alexis did
not take time to reverse the weapon he still held by the point. Raising
it high above his head, he carefully gauged the distance, and let fly.
The sword went hurtling through the air, turning once in its flight.
Alexis&#8217; aim was true, and the point of the weapon pierced the
German commander squarely between the shoulder blades. He threw up his
hands and fell forward on his face.</p>

<p>Alexis turned and surveyed the battle.</p>

<p>The Germans had been pressed back by the Russians, led by Hal and
Chester, until now they were fighting desperately on the stern of the
vessel. Alexis dashed forward to take part in this fray; but the
Germans, having witnessed the death of their commander, had lost heart.
Perceiving the giant form rushing down upon them, they threw down their
arms as one man. Some turned quickly and leaped overboard into the
river and struck out for the shore, while others stood quietly waiting
to be bound by their captors. The battle was over.</p>

<p>Immediately the commander of the Russian steamer ordered his men and
the prisoners back aboard his own ship. Then he turned to Hal and
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have taken such a prominent part in this
victory,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will allow you to finish the work by
blowing up the enemy. You will attach a fuse to the magazine and then
hurry back here, that we may reach safety before the
explosion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads saluted, and made their way to the magazine of the
German vessel. Here they quickly attached a fuse, and lighted it. Then
they hurried aboard the Russian steamer, which immediately got under
way. One hundred yards, two hundred yards, three hundred, they steamed
from the doomed vessel; then there came the sound of a muffled
explosion, the German craft burst into a sheet of flame, broke into two
pieces, and settled slowly beneath the waters of the Vistula.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good job done,&#8221; said the Russian commander
briefly.</p>

<p>He turned once more to the two lads. &#8220;I want to say,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;that it has never been my fortune to meet two braver
lads. You are English, I take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans,&#8221; replied Hal briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? Still, I might have known it. I have known several
Americans, and they were always cool and brave. Where do you wish to go
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;we would like to get back to
Lodz. I suppose our regiment is still stationed there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see that you get there with all possible
dispatch,&#8221; the commander promised. &#8220;I will land you where
it will be most convenient for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads thanked him, and walked across the deck, where they
rejoined Alexis and Stephan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would make a pretty good sailor, Alexis,&#8221; Chester
told him.</p>

<p>The Cossack drew himself up and strutted proudly for several
moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I would,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is nothing new
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing new!&#8221; exclaimed Hal in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you have been a sailor?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Of course the commander of this vessel did a fair
piece of work a few moments ago; but I could tell him a few things.
Why, when I commanded a ship in the battle of&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough! Enough!&#8221; cried Hal, throwing up his hands in
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you doubt my word?&#8221; demanded Alexis fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Hal hastened to assure him. &#8220;But,
Alexis; have you learned yet what &#8216;drawing the long bow&#8217;
means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the giant, &#8220;are you going to tell me
at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had about decided to,&#8221; said Hal slowly; &#8220;but
after this, never!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><span
class='fss'>INTO THE CARPATHIANS.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the Grand Duke Nicholas, &#8220;you find that
there are adventures to be found in the eastern as well as the western
theater of war, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell me,&#8221; continued the Grand Duke, &#8220;what do
you think of the Cossacks as fighters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what we have seen,&#8221; replied Chester, &#8220;I
should say that there are none better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; was the emphatic rejoinder. &#8220;There are
none better!&#8221; and he regarded the lads silently for some
moments.</p>

<p>Hal, Chester, Alexis, Stephan and Marquis, after the battle on the
Vistula, had returned to Lodz without difficulty. The commander of the
Russian river steamer had made it as easy for them as possible. In Lodz
they learned that their regiment had been ordered to the front, and had
been on their way to join it, when the Grand Duke, inspecting his
troops, had come upon them. He immediately had the two lads taken to
his quarters, for he was greatly interested in them. Alexis, Stephan
and Marquis waited without.</p>

<p>At last the Grand Duke spoke. &#8220;I have a mission for you, if
you are willing to undertake it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good! As you may know, my primary aim, from the
beginning of the war, was an invasion of Hungary&#8211;the capture
first of Budapest and next of Vienna. This necessitates the capture of
Cracow, in Galicia, and the forcing of a passage through the Carpathian
mountains&#8211;a tremendous feat at this time of year. The investment
of Cracow is certain. Even now my troops are within a few miles of that
stronghold, and I had word this morning that part of it is in flames.
Do you follow me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied both lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well! Now, in some unaccountable manner, my plans have
always been anticipated by the Austrians. How or by whom I do not know;
but I believe it has been by some of Brunnoi&#8217;s bandits, who have
a stronghold in the Carpathians, but mingle freely with our soldiers.
Do you know who Brunnoi is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; from both the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Brunnoi is a veritable bandit chief&#8211;a man of
great cunning and influence, besides being a born gentleman. A
Hungarian, and therefore a Slav, he should naturally support the
Russian cause. He has a strong following and his men would make
first-rate soldiers. We are seeking his support, and so are the
Austrians. However, if it is through his spies that my plans are being
given to the Austrians I would like to know it. Do I make myself
clear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;that you would have us find
out just where he stands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly! He has sent me word that he will espouse our cause,
but I fear he may be double-dealing. Naturally, therefore, you will
keep your identities secret. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads saluted, and turned to depart, but before they could leave
the tent a man in civilian garb entered the tent. The Grand Duke
greeted him warmly and then called to the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to introduce you to Count de Reslau,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;He, if any man, can give you information that may be of aid to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads acknowledged the introduction, and as he recognized the
newcomer, Hal started back. The latter smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you remember me,&#8221; he said pleasantly. &#8220;I
must apologize for my previous rudeness. I did not then know you were
friends of the Grand Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads bowed. Count de Reslau was the man who had laughed at
Alexis in a store in Lodz some time before&#8211;the man whom the lads
believed to be responsible for their being set upon in the street. The
count explained the matter to the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;I am sure these lads
bear no malice.&#8221; To the boys he added: &#8220;The count is one of
my best friends. Being a Hungarian he has not taken up arms against
Hungary, although he is in sympathy with us. I am sure he can aid
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then gave the count an idea of the mission the lads were about to
undertake, and the count promised to help them in every way
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; said Hal, as they prepared to take
leave of the Grand Duke, &#8220;have we your permission to take Alexis
with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is Alexis?&#8221; demanded the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>Chester explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him by all means,&#8221; was the Grand Duke&#8217;s
reply; &#8220;and return to me at the earliest possible
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads saluted and left the tent. Alexis joined them on the
outside and the boys told him of the work ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about me?&#8221; Stephan demanded. &#8220;Am I not to
go too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am sorry,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;The Grand Duke
said nothing about you. Besides, three are better than four.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephan was greatly disappointed, and showed it plainly. However, he
was not a man to complain. He wished them good luck, shook hands all
around and set off to rejoin his own regiment.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hal bethought himself of Marquis.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t take him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He would be
in the way. What shall we do with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis bethought himself of a friend in the city who, he was sure,
would be glad to look out for the dog while they were away. Accordingly
Marquis was taken to this home, where the woman of the house readily
agreed to take care of him; but when they came to leave, Marquis wanted
to go, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hal, and he talked to the dog quietly for
several minutes, explaining to him the necessity of his remaining
behind.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the dog understood, for a sorrowful
look came over his face. His tail wagged in understanding of his
orders, but there was a hurt look in his eyes. However, he did not
protest, and when his three friends finally walked away, he stood
looking after them regretfully, although making no attempt to
follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;is to procure three
good horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Alexis, &#8220;and another to carry
food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Hal. &#8220;We cannot be bothered with
that. We shall have to live off the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis made no objection, though it was plain to both lads that the
Cossack would have rather made due preparations to care for the inner
man. Three strong, wiry Cossack horses having been placed at their
command, the three leaped into the saddles and set off through the
streets of Lodz at a slow trot.</p>

<p>Darkness was falling when they came to the outskirts of the city,
and turned their heads toward the southwest. As far as Cracow the roads
were held by Russian troops in force, and the three travelers
experienced no difficulties. They did not go close to the beleaguered
city, but bore off a bit to the north, just skirting the great Russian
army before the Galician stronghold.</p>

<p>Three days and nights they traveled without incident. Their food
they purchased at little towns through which they passed, or at
farmhouses; and they slept wherever they happened to be when night
overtook them. But now that they were drawing close to the Carpathians,
Hal decided that the order of things must be reversed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the future we shall travel at night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our sleeping in the daytime.&#8221;</p>

<p>This plan was approved by both Chester and Alexis, so that the
morning of the fourth day found them approaching the long line of
mountains.</p>

<p>The Carpathian mountains encircle Hungary on three sides, separating
it from Germany on the northwest, from Galicia on the northeast and
from Turkey on the southeast. At the southern extremity of the range, a
branch proceeds in a southerly direction across the Danube to the
center of European Turkey, connecting the Carpathian mountains with the
great eastern branch of the Alps.</p>

<p>It can readily be seen, therefore, that the Carpathians are much
like the Alps&#8211;made up of rugged peaks between which are narrow
passes. These passes furnish the only means of getting across the
mountains.</p>

<p>In their search for Brunnoi, the boys and Alexis were now
approaching that part of the mountains which separates Hungary from
Galicia, and through which there are but three passes; so that their
traveling had to be done slowly and with great care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you will permit me, I shall take the lead,&#8221;
said Alexis. &#8220;I have been in these parts before. Besides I have
been told of certain landmarks in these foothills which indicate where
Brunnoi holds forth&#8211;not definitely enough to lead us straight to
him; but I have a general idea of the direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>No objection being offered, Alexis swung into the lead and the
horses plunged up a narrow pass into the midst of the wild hills,
probably the wildest and most desolate spot in all Europe. Great trees
and massive rocks overhung the little pass, making progress extremely
difficult. At the top of the first steep incline, the riders allowed
their horses to stop and rest. Then they fared on again.</p>

<p>It was nearing daylight when they came upon a small hut, shrouded by
trees, through which a dim light twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait here until daylight,&#8221; said Hal,
&#8220;and when the occupants of the hut come out we will accost
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited. Daylight came, and with its coming, a man came from the
hut. Hal approached him, and addressed him in German. The man looked at
him shrewdly, and then answered in the same tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can spare you something to
eat; also your friends. May I ask what you are doing in the
mountains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are trying to make our way to Budapest,&#8221; replied
Hal. &#8220;We were captured by the Russians, and escaped. We are not
familiar with the ground, however, and have met with
difficulties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man of the hut, &#8220;I can set you
right. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the meal they talked of the war. Finally Chester said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any truth in the report that Brunnoi will go over to
the Russians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None!&#8221; cried the man, striking the table a hard blow
with his fist. &#8220;I know, because I am one of his men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Hal, in well simulated surprise,
though he had surmised as much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man quietly. &#8220;Brigands, they have
called us. But they will find that when the Russians attempt to cross
the Carpathians, as they surely will, we bandits will give as good an
account of ourselves as will the trained troops. We love our country
just as well as do those who live in Budapest. But tell me, you are not
Hungarians nor Austrians, nor even Germans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hal, thankful that they had been wise enough
to discard their uniforms before setting out upon their mission.
&#8220;We are Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I have heard much of them.
And you have been fighting with the German army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Chester truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this man,&#8221; said their host, turning to Alexis.
&#8220;Is he an American also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Hal, and signified for Alexis not to
speak, for fear that his accent might betray him.</p>

<p>Their host was evidently satisfied. The meal finished, the man
walked with them to the door, and pointed out the direction they were
to take. Then he pointed also to the southwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that direction,&#8221; he said, &#8220;lies the home of
Brunnoi. No, there is no truth that he will espouse the Russian cause.
Even now he is able to do much harm to their cause. He is with Austria
to the last drop of blood in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three took their departure, going in the direction the man had
pointed out. But once out of sight, Hal changed the course, and they
bore off to the southwest for several hours, looking for a place to
secrete themselves for the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to be very careful,&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>The truth of this statement was proved a moment later. From behind
came the sharp crack of a rifle. Chester&#8217;s hat leaped from his
head.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE BANDIT CHIEF.</span></h2>

<p>Hal, Chester and Alexis threw themselves to the ground with a single
movement. A second bullet sped harmlessly overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t come here to fight,&#8221; Hal whispered to
his friends, &#8220;so here goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a handkerchief from his pocket, and waved it aloft. This was
answered by a command in German, from some distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up; put your hands above your heads and
advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three friends did as commanded. Three swarthy-faced men, with
leveled revolvers, advanced to meet them. Quickly they searched their
prisoners, relieved them of their weapons, and bound their hands
securely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward march,&#8221; commanded one, poking the muzzle of his
weapon into the small of Chester&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. The three friends obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking us?&#8221; demanded Hal of one of their
captors.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Brunnoi!&#8221; came the brief response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; said Hal to Chester, in English.
&#8220;We certainly couldn&#8217;t have got there quicker any other
way. You don&#8217;t suppose he has learned of our mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that is possible,&#8221; replied
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I; I suppose the thing to do is to try and convince him
we are German soldiers, or else come straight out and tell him who we
really are and why we are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The latter way might be best,&#8221; said Chester,
thoughtfully. &#8220;For Brunnoi after all may not be such a staunch
Austrian supporter as our late host would have us believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s ride they came to a little clearing in the
forest that covered this point of the mountain. Here they were ordered
to dismount, and for half a mile proceeded on foot. As they advanced
still further the lads made out the mouth of a huge cavern. Into this
dark hole their captors pushed them. Down the mouth of the cavern they
walked, and then suddenly came to a sharp turn. Ten more paces and they
bumped into a solid wall. One of their captors stepped forward and
passed his hand over the surface of the smooth rock, and it gave way
before him, turning on well-oiled hinges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; muttered Chester. &#8220;I have read of
these things, but I never expected to see one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rock fell into place behind them, and the boys saw that they
stood in a well-lighted compartment, in which stood a table and chairs.
Their guards led them further along, to where they perceived a closed
door. On this one of their captors knocked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; came a deep voice from beyond the door.</p>

<p>One of the guards opened the heavy wooden door, and stood back,
signifying for the prisoners to enter.</p>

<p>The three friends did so. The room was brilliantly lighted. At a
large mahogany desk sat a man in a military uniform, though of what
country or what his rank the boys could not tell, for they had never
seen a similar uniform and the man wore no shoulder straps. The chairs
in the room were beautifully upholstered, and pictures were hung about
the walls. All this the lads saw at a single glance.</p>

<p>The man at the desk rose and approached them. He bowed slightly,
and, after ordering their hands released, indicated three nearby
chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be seated, if you please,&#8221; he said politely, at the
same time motioning the guards to withdraw.</p>

<p>Hal, Chester and Alexis did as requested. There was now no question
of the man&#8217;s identity in the mind of any. He wore a long white
beard and had a pleasant, kindly face.</p>

<p>Hal rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Brunnoi?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Brunnoi bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Now, what can I do
for Lieutenants Payne and Crawford, and their Cossack
friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads started to their feet upon hearing their own names thus
upon the lips of a man they did not believe could possibly know
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, gentlemen,&#8221; said Brunnoi, smiling at their
surprise. &#8220;You see, many things are known to me. For instance,
now, I could even tell you the object of your expedition to these
mountains. Is it necessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal threw wide his arms with a gesture of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it is not necessary,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Brunnoi, for the first time evincing real
interest in the lad. &#8220;You are a man after my own heart. You have
nothing to gain by subterfuge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal slowly. &#8220;You know who we are and
the object of our mission. What is your answer? Are you Austrian or
Russian? Are you a Slav or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brunnoi jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I am a Slav; but I am not one
of your down-trodden Russian Slavs. I am a Hungarian, and a
Hungarian&#8211;a true Hungarian&#8211;to-day is an
Austrian!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Hal calmly, &#8220;our mission is
accomplished. We know where you stand. May I ask you a
question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that you have been able to furnish the Austrian
general staff with the Grand Duke Nicholas&#8217; plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brunnoi was silent for some moments, but at length he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind answering that question, for you will
never repeat my answer to the Grand Duke. Yes, I have furnished the
Austrian general staff with important information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Chester, breaking into the conversation,
&#8220;what are you going to do with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Brunnoi, &#8220;for the present you shall be
kept here as my guests&#8211;prisoners, if you prefer. After
that&#8211;well, it all depends. Should the Russians come, it may be
necessary to dispose of you. Therefore, you should be wise and pray for
Austrian success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you do not mean that you would murder us?&#8221; asked
Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it by no such name,&#8221; replied Brunnoi calmly.
&#8220;Putting away an enemy is not murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Chester calmly. &#8220;I suppose there
is no use talking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the slightest. Come! Follow me, and I shall show you
where you will make your home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bandit chief arose from his chair and led the way into another
compartment. Hal, Chester and Alexis followed him. This room was also
fitted up comfortably, though not as pretentiously as the
bandit&#8217;s office. There were several beds in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may make yourselves comfortable here,&#8221; said
Brunnoi. &#8220;The door will be always locked, but that need not
interfere with your comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed and left the room, and the three prisoners heard the key
turn in the lock behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me as though we are in a bad way this time, all
right,&#8221; said Chester, when they were left alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad way is no name for it,&#8221; replied Hal; &#8220;but
tell me, Chester, did you notice anything familiar about
Brunnoi?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester clapped his hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Now that you mention it,
it seems to me I have seen him some place before. But I can&#8217;t
place him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I; but I am positive this is not the first time we have
met. It is his voice that puzzles me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain the boys racked their brains. Alexis was called into
consultation. He also had been impressed by Brunnoi&#8217;s likeness to
some one he had seen before; but he was unable to throw any light upon
the resemblance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Chester at length, &#8220;I can&#8217;t
place him and that&#8217;s all there is about it. Nevertheless, I am
absolutely certain I have met him some place before to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door to their prison was now opened and food was placed upon the
table in the center of the room. All three were nearly famished, and
they fell to with a will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fattening us up for the slaughter,&#8221; said Chester with a
laugh. &#8220;However, I guess they won&#8217;t kill us
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the hours passed. There was not a single window or opening in
the room, and the prisoners could not tell whether it was day or night
outside. But now Hal, glancing at his watch, uttered an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost midnight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess we might as
well turn in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal and Chester tumbled into the beds, but Alexis continued to sit
in his chair, brooding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Alexis, get to bed,&#8221; Hal called. &#8220;What
on earth&#8217;s the matter, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis did not reply, and Hal repeated his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;what a
fool I was to let these fellows take my gun away from me without even a
struggle. With a good gun apiece, we might be able to get away from
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;We are not going to be
killed. While there is life there is hope. We&#8217;ll get out of this
ticklish situation somehow. Just be patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patient!&#8221; echoed Alexis; &#8220;how can a man be
patient cooped up in a place like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it can&#8217;t be helped now,&#8221; said Chester.
&#8220;Come on to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alexis was in no mood to turn in. For perhaps another half-hour
he sat brooding; then he arose and made a tour of the room. He put his
hand on the doorknob and tried it. It was securely locked, and the
Cossack had no doubt that it was also bolted on the far side. He
rattled the knob angrily, but there was no answer from the outside.</p>

<p>Alexis continued his tour of inspection. He eyed the table
speculatively. It was made of oak and while not of great bulk was very
heavy&#8211;as much as two ordinary men could lift. Alexis picked it up
and tested its weight. Then he growled something to himself.</p>

<p>He also tested the chairs and even the bed on which he was to sleep,
all the time growling to himself like a dog. Then, his tour of the room
completed, he sat down in his chair again. Hal and Chester had been
watching him from beneath lowered lids.</p>

<p>Hal raised himself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find anything?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Alexis vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; cried Chester, sitting up. &#8220;Are you
going to mope around all night? Come to bed and get a little rest, that
you may be fit to meet any emergency should it arise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; growled Alexis to himself, and
extinguishing the light, threw himself upon his bed.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV.<br /><span
class='fss'>GETTING AWAY.</span></h2>

<p>All were up long before a guard appeared with breakfast. This they
ate leisurely and then sat down to talk their predicament over
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be some way of getting out of here,&#8221; said
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Hal; &#8220;and if we are fond of life, I
believe we had better get away soon. But what can we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You leave this to me,&#8221; growled Alexis. &#8220;I have it
all figured out and when the time comes, we will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Chester. &#8220;You have found a way
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the giant briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&#8213;&#8221; began Chester, but he was interrupted by
the sound of a key turning in the lock of the door.</p>

<p>A moment later the smiling face of Brunnoi appeared in the doorway.
He entered the room and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to tell you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I am
going away for possibly a week. You shall be kept here until I return.
By that time I will have decided just what to do with you. I am taking
most of my men with me, but I have no fear of your getting out of this
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are grateful for your thoughtfulness in letting us know
you are going away,&#8221; said Hal sarcastically. &#8220;I am sure we
shall miss you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of that,&#8221; replied Brunnoi. &#8220;Your meals
will be brought to you at regular intervals. Till I return
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand airily and stepped quickly through the door,
closing and locking it behind him. Immediately he had left the room
Alexis jumped to his feet. Hal and Chester watched him in surprise.</p>

<p>The giant Cossack walked over to the bed in which he had slept and
quickly stripped it of its coverings. Then, when nothing but the bare
frame remained he stepped inside of it. Doubling up his huge fist, he
drove it into the footboard with tremendous force. There was a
splintering crash and it fell in twain. Wrapping his hardly-used
knuckles in a cloth he picked up from the floor, he repeated the
operation on the headboard&#8211;and the bed lay in four pieces on the
floor.</p>

<p>Seizing the first portion by one of the heavy legs, he tore at it
with his naked fingers, like a dog at a bone; and soon, exerting his
tremendous strength, he had stripped it clean. The second of the
smaller legs he treated in the same manner, and likewise one of the
larger legs at the head. Then, with these three clubs in his hands, he
approached the two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a weapon apiece for you,&#8221; he said, extending
one of the smaller legs to the lads.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester each took the proffered weapons. They were ungainly
and heavy, but the lads realized that they were indeed formidable
weapons. Alexis stood looking at them with the big leg resting lightly
on his right shoulder. It was a massive piece of wood, this third leg,
a terrible weapon in the hands of a giant like Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;we have these weapons, but
how are we going to get out of here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you,&#8221; replied the giant.
&#8220;As soon as we are certain the bandit king is well on his way,
we&#8217;ll get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour they waited&#8211;two hours, before Alexis rose slowly to
his feet, indicating that the time for action had come. Slowly he
approached the door and pressed his great weight against it. It did not
budge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you are not expecting to get out that way?&#8221; said
Hal.</p>

<p>Alexis did not deign to reply. Instead he walked over to the table
in the center of the room, and with a single movement swept the dishes
on to the floor. Then, lifting the heavy table, he raised it above his
head, and advanced upon the door.</p>

<p>Once, twice, thrice the stout oak table crashed against the solid
door. It gave slightly. The giant struck the door a fourth tremendous
blow, and the table burst into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it
would give.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid so, too,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>Alexis said nothing. Instead he approached the door, and pressed
against it&#8211;testing it. Then he turned, and without exertion,
wheeled a second massive bed into position before the door. This he
braced with the third bed, so that by straining his hardest, he could
not budge them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; demanded Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; replied the giant briefly.</p>

<p>He stepped between the door and the first bed, close to it. Here,
bracing himself against the bed, he laid his great hands against the
door and pushed. There was a slight cracking noise. Under this terrible
force, the door was straining. And still the giant kept up the
pressure.</p>

<p>The muscles in the back of his neck stood out like bands of iron.
The sinews in his bare arms quivered and seemed about to leap from
beneath his skin; and still Alexis struggled with the unyielding door.
There came again the sound of cracking; and the giant released the
pressure. Even from where they stood, the lads could see the door sway
inward into place, thus showing the pressure that had been put against
it.</p>

<p>The two lads were lost in admiration of the great strength of
Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible,&#8221; said Hal, half to
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t possible,&#8221; declared Chester.</p>

<p>But Alexis did not heed these remarks. Hurling the beds away with
fierce kicks, he cleared a space in front of the door. Then he drew
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; exclaimed Chester in an awed voice.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, Alexis drew himself together for a spring. Ten
quick steps he took, and then hurled his giant frame against the heavy
door. There was a thud as he smashed against it, followed by a great
crash of splintering wood, and Alexis, door and all went down in a
tangled heap.</p>

<p>Quickly the giant extricated himself and darted back into the room,
where he picked up his massive club. Whirling it wildly about his head
he shouted to the lads:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a moment&#8217;s delay, surprised as they were, the lads
lifted their own weapons, and dashed after the Cossack. Straight out
the door of the bandit chief&#8217;s private room the three ran into
the corridor beyond. Sprawling figures sitting idly about gave evidence
that the chief had not taken all of his men with him. At the abrupt
entrance of Alexis these jumped to their feet, drawing knives and
swords.</p>

<p>Alexis was upon them in a trice, Hal and Chester close behind him.
Rapidly the huge club of the giant rose and fell, once, twice,
thrice&#8211;even to five times, and with each crushing blow a man went
down with a crushed skull. The others drew back.</p>

<p>The two lads now ranged themselves on either side of Alexis, and
together they charged the foe. There was no escape for the bandits, now
backed into a corner; but they fought back with a desperation born of
despair. Three minutes later there was not a man standing on his
feet.</p>

<p>Alexis rested the end of his club upon the ground, and leaning on
it, wiped the perspiration from his brow. Then, after a brief rest, he
led the way to the entrance to the cavern, barred by the great
rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;I am afraid, is where we
stop. We do not know how to open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis pushed the lads aside and examined the rock. Then, without a
word, he dropped his club and put his shoulder to the boulder that
barred the exit. The first attempt made no impression. Taking a deep
breath, the giant tried again. Putting every ounce of his herculean
strength into this final effort, he exerted himself to the utmost.</p>

<p>Slowly the huge rock began to move. Slowly it began to swing
outward. Then, more rapidly, until, as the catch was released, it swung
away back on its hinges. Alexis, unable to recover his balance, fell
forward on his face. He was up in a moment, however, and the three
darted from the cavern.</p>

<p>For half a mile they sprinted, seeking to put as great a distance as
possible between themselves and the cavern before pausing for breath.
Then, suddenly, Alexis toppled over on the ground.</p>

<p>Hal dropped to his knees and gently raised the giant&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Chester! Some water!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Chester darted away, and soon returned with water in his cap. This
Hal sprinkled over the giant&#8217;s face. His efforts were rewarded at
length. The color slowly returned, and Alexis heaved a deep sigh.
Consciousness was returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; said Hal softly. &#8220;He has worn
himself out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;and had we not brought him
along, we would still be prisoners in the cavern, with our death only a
question of days or hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;And such strength,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I never saw before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I ever expect to see again,&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>Now Alexis stirred and groaned. Then he sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through your prowess and bravery,&#8221; Hal made answer,
&#8220;we have escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis jumped to his feet and patted himself on the chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am a brave man; and I am
a strong man, am I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no question about either,&#8221; replied
Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; continued the giant, &#8220;all things
considered, that was not such a remarkable feat. Now I remember
once&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, taking Alexis by the arm, &#8220;we
must get away from here. The story can wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis subsided without further words, and the three continued on
their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing to do now,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;is to get back
to Lodz as quickly as we can. With luck, we should make it in four
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Chester, &#8220;we have learned what we
set out to learn. There is no use delaying.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attention of all three was at that moment attracted by the sound
of galloping horses, nearby. The hoof beats were coming toward them.
Alexis sprang to action.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have horses,&#8221; he said in a hoarse whisper.
&#8220;Otherwise we will be weeks getting back. We will take
these.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; demanded both lads in a single voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; commanded the giant.</p>

<p>Breaking into a quick run he hurried along the road to where it
curved sharply. Here they could not be seen by the approaching riders
until they actually met.</p>

<p>Alexis took his stand in the center of the road, motioning for the
boys to take positions, one on each side of the road. Then all stood
waiting.</p>

<p>The hoof beats drew nearer, and then the horses came trotting round
the bend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only three! Good!&#8221; Hal muttered to himself
unconsciously.</p>

<p>The riders were right upon Alexis before they realized that their
way was blocked. They quickly drew rein and attempted to check their
animals; but it was too late. Alexis had two of the horses by the
bridles, and pushing them back on their haunches by main strength,
succeeded in unseating the riders.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester pounced upon the two unhorsed men, and had their
weapons before they could make a move to defend themselves. Alexis,
still holding to the two horses, called upon the lads to cover the
third rider, who seemed about to make a dash for liberty.</p>

<p>Hal was quick to obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;One move,&#8221; he said quietly, as he pointed his
newly-acquired revolver squarely at the third man, &#8220;and you are a
dead man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter raised his hands above his head. While Hal kept him
covered, Chester advanced and relieved him of his weapons. Then he
ordered him to dismount.</p>

<p>Alexis now approached with the other two horses, one of which he
turned over to Chester. Hal took the third horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are sorry to be forced to do this,&#8221; said Hal to the
men whose horses they had appropriated, &#8220;but necessity knows no
law. We need these animals worse than you do; therefore, we take
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are thankful,&#8221; said one of the men, &#8220;that you
have spared our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly the three friends leaped into their saddles, and spurred
their horses onward.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br /><span
class='fss'>ATTACKED.</span></h2>

<p>For several hours the friends rode along the narrow mountain pass
without incident. They stopped once at a little mountain stream to
quench their thirst and to allow their horses to drink. Then they rode
on again.</p>

<p>Rounding a sharp turn in the road, they came squarely upon half a
dozen riders, all attired in Austrian uniforms. Hal realized their
peril and acted upon the instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; he shouted to his two friends. &#8220;Ride them
down!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Austrians were no less surprised than the three friends at this
unexpected encounter; but they also acted quickly. They reined in their
horses and drew their swords and revolvers.</p>

<p>But before they had time to bring their revolvers to bear, the two
lads and the huge Cossack were upon them, Hal slightly in the lead.</p>

<p>Hal fired one shot as he swept down upon the foe, but there was no
time for more. The nine horsemen met with a shock, but the Austrians,
being motionless, had the worst of it. The momentum of the horses
ridden by the two lads and the Cossack carried them through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride!&#8221; shouted Hal, as they burst through the
enemy.</p>

<p>It was no time for fighting if it could be avoided, and the lads
realized it. All three put spurs to their horses and dashed down the
road, rounding a bend just as the Austrians, having recovered, fired.
None was hit.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is one time where discretion is the better part of
valor,&#8221; panted Hal to his friends, who were riding close beside
him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll run for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Austrians quickly turned their horses and dashed on in
pursuit.</p>

<p>Hal, glancing back, saw that the enemy was not gaining, and reported
this to his friends. Thus encouraged, they urged their mounts even
faster, and before long had drawn out of sight of the pursuers. But at
the very moment they seemed to be safe, Chester&#8217;s horse stumbled
and fell, hurling the lad headlong.</p>

<p>Quickly the others drew up and rushed to his assistance. The lad was
not badly hurt, and was soon able to stand. Then, from the rear, came
the sounds of their pursuers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stand here,&#8221; cried Hal. &#8220;Quick,
Chester! Into this clump of trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester did as told and Alexis followed him. Hal, however, seizing
the two horses that were standing led them in between the trees. Then
he sprang to the side of the fallen animal. Grasping him by the head,
he succeeded in getting him to his feet and under cover just before the
Austrians came into sight. A minute later the Austrians swept by.</p>

<p>Hal breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty close,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s
get out of here by the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leading the two horses they started on. Five minutes later there
loomed up through the trees what appeared to be a barn. They advanced
toward it. Not a soul was about, but they proceeded cautiously for they
did not wish to walk into a trap.</p>

<p>Hal tried the door to the barn. It was locked. Alexis soon remedied
this, however. One quick twitch of his wrist and the lock came off. Hal
went in, and started back with a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221; repeated Hal. &#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped back and Chester peered over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Automobiles!&#8221; he said in astonishment</p>

<p>It was true. Inside the shed were four large touring cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth can they be doing here, I wonder,&#8221; said
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea,&#8221; replied Hal,
&#8220;but if we can find any petrol I should say it is a lucky find
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a rapid inspection of the shed, and stopped at the far end
with a low whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Petrol,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;Gallons and gallons of it.
Now what do you suppose it is here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t concern us,&#8221; said Chester dryly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll fill up the tank of one of these cars and get
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly this was done, and the car was run out the door. Chester
climbed into the rear seat and motioned for Alexis to follow him.
Alexis hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been in one of those things,&#8221; he said
slowly. &#8220;Now, a horse is all right. I know all about a horse. But
I don&#8217;t know anything about these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;Get in here
quick. Those Austrians are likely to be back any minute and we must
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis climbed in, plainly not without trepidation, and sank back in
one of the comfortable seats. Hal already had taken his place at the
wheel, and slowly the large machine moved forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Hal to Chester, &#8220;whether we can
go down these passes safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where a machine has gone once, another may go,&#8221; said
Chester calmly. &#8220;Besides, if you&#8217;ll notice, there is a
well-defined track ahead of you, and unless I am much mistaken, it goes
not toward the road but away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;You are right. Now I
wonder how that happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually the car gathered speed, until it was traveling along at a
good gait. Hal did not wish to go too fast, for he was not familiar
with the roads, and besides, the steep grade also precluded this.</p>

<p>Night fell. Hal stopped the car long enough to light the
searchlights.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may betray our presence,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but if I
don&#8217;t light them we are likely to go into a ditch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car crept along slowly during the night hours, and morning found
them still in the mountains. With the coming of dawn, however, Hal put
on more speed, and by noon they were once more on the plains of
Galicia. Then Hal &#8220;let her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the machine flashed by a body of troops. Hal swerved to one
side of the road just in time to avoid running into them. Chester
caught a glimpse of their uniforms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russians!&#8221; he called to Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; the latter called back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>Hal reduced the speed of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that event I&#8217;ll slow down,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The car went along now at a more moderate pace; but once again on a
road clear of troops, the speed was increased. They made several stops
along the route, and it was late the following afternoon when they
recognized the familiar minarets of Lodz. Half an hour later the lads
were admitted to the presence of the Grand Duke, Alexis remaining
outside in the automobile.</p>

<p>Hal made his report to the Grand Duke clearly and concisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared as much,&#8221; said the Russian commander-in-chief,
when the lad had finished. &#8220;You have done well, however. You will
rejoin your regiment as soon as convenient.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Count de Reslau appeared in the Grand Duke&#8217;s
tent. He did not at first notice the presence of the two lads, and
bowed to the Russian commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency&#8213;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>At that moment his eyes rested on Hal and Chester and a look of
surprise and consternation passed over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the latter quietly.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke turned to the count with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they have successfully performed their mission,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But it is even as I have feared. Brunnoi will support
Austria. And what is worse, my plans are being learned by at least one
of his agents and sent to the Austrian general staff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed the count, who had now regained
his composure. He turned to the two lads. &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;when I saw you last I did not expect that you would ever
return here. It was a hazardous mission the Duke sent you on. Are you
sure your information is authentic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; replied Hal calmly. &#8220;Brunnoi himself
was our informer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the count with a shrug of his
shoulders, &#8220;you must be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned, and with a few brief words to the Grand Duke, left the
tent. The lads talked for some moments with the Russian
commander-in-chief, and then left the tent, informing him that they
would join their regiment the following day. Outside, they climbed
again into the automobile and Hal drove the car to the house where they
had left Marquis.</p>

<p>The dog was overjoyed at seeing his friends again. His tail wagged
fiercely and he barked with gladness, insisting upon kissing all three,
in spite of their protests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, Marquis!&#8221; cried Hal with a laugh. &#8220;Do you
want to eat us up. Now what do you say, sir, will you be glad to rejoin
your regiment to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221; barked Marquis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;But we will leave you here
while we get something to eat. Then we will come back and get
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three left the house, and made their way to the nearest
restaurant, where they ordered a sumptuous meal. It had been long days
since they had tasted food in plenty, and they ate hungrily. It was
almost dark when they left the restaurant and started after
Marquis.</p>

<p>As they passed down a side street, five men armed with long knives
sprang out upon them. The three friends were caught off their guard by
the suddenness of the attack, and in spite of the fact that they drew
their swords, for they were again in uniform, their assailants pressed
them sorely. A sword thrust pierced Hal in the arm, and his weapon fell
to the ground. He drew his revolver with his left hand, however, and
fired point-blank at his adversary. His aim was true, and there was one
enemy less.</p>

<p>At the same moment Chester ran his opponent through, and Alexis
brought another to the ground. The other two turned and fled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what that was for?&#8221; said Chester, brushing
himself off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why we should have been
attacked,&#8221; declared Hal.</p>

<p>He broke off; for at that moment he espied a figure standing in a
nearby doorway; eyeing them evilly. Hal caught Chester by the arm, and
pointed to the figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the answer,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>Chester gazed in the direction indicated. Then, with a sudden cry,
both boys dashed toward the doorway.</p>

<p>For the man they saw, with a sneer curving his lips, wore a long,
flowing, white beard and a military uniform.</p>

<p>He was Brunnoi, chief of the Hungarian bandits!</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br /><span
class='fss'>A STRANGE DISCOVERY.</span></h2>

<p>Seeing that he was discovered, Brunnoi darted from the doorway and
tried to escape. But he was not quick enough. The lads were upon him in
an instant, and beneath their weight the bandit chief was hurled to the
ground. He struggled fiercely, clawing and scratching like a cat; but
Hal and Chester were too much for him.</p>

<p>Brunnoi finally ceased his struggles and lay quietly in the
lads&#8217; hands. Hal took him by the collar and jerked him to his
feet; then, each lad taking an arm, they led their prisoner straight to
the Grand Duke&#8217;s quarters. They were admitted instantly, and
pushing their captive before them, they approached the Russian
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom have you there?&#8221; demanded the Grand Duke, looking
at the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brunnoi, sir,&#8221; replied Hal calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the Grand Duke, springing to his feet.
&#8220;Is this the bandit chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, sir,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Brunnoi,&#8221; said the bandit calmly. &#8220;You have
me. What will you do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be shot in the morning!&#8221; cried the Grand Duke
angrily.</p>

<p>Brunnoi smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you are mistaken,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke grew very angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be shot at eight o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said very
quietly. &#8220;You have already caused me much trouble. I can&#8217;t
afford to let you escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He summoned a guard of an officer and ten men, and turned the bandit
chief over to them, with orders that he be shot in the morning at eight
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>As Brunnoi was led by the three lads, he smiled at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see you later,&#8221; he said calmly.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke thanked the lads for their important capture, and
then, with Alexis, they made their way to the house where Marquis was
waiting for them. They were given connecting rooms and were soon in
bed.</p>

<p>Tired out they slept heavily. Therefore, while they had expected to
arise before eight o&#8217;clock, nine found them still sleeping. They
were awakened at last, however, by the sounds of a commotion in the
adjoining room.</p>

<p>The two lads sat up in bed and listened intently. Heavy footsteps
tramped toward their door and it was thrown open with a quick jerk.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester uttered exclamations of surprise. Confronting them,
in the doorway, was the smiling face of Brunnoi, who was to have been
put to death an hour before. In his hand he held two revolvers,
covering the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I have kept my word,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was not
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you escape?&#8221; demanded Hal, asking the only
question he could think of at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; replied the bandit. &#8220;Get your
clothes on quickly, and come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the muzzles of the two revolvers, the lads dressed hurriedly.
The presence of Alexis in the adjoining room&#8211;the giant lying
completely covered up by bed clothes&#8211;passed unnoticed. But
Alexis, beneath his covering, heard what was going on and
understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go out ahead of me,&#8221; ordered Brunnoi.</p>

<p>He dropped his two revolvers into side pockets, but kept his fingers
on the trigger of each.</p>

<p>&#8220;One false move and I&#8217;ll drop you,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;Now, march!&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the lads left the room, and Brunnoi followed them; but hardly
had they disappeared through the door, when Alexis bounded out of bed
and silently followed.</p>

<p>At the outside door, Brunnoi stepped back to allow his captives to
pass out first. For an instant he was off his guard. It was
Alexis&#8217; opportunity and he leaped suddenly forward.</p>

<p>Brunnoi heard the sound of the giant&#8217;s footsteps. He turned
quickly, and drew his revolvers, but the Cossack&#8217;s leap was too
quick. With a single movement he sent both of the weapons from the
bandit&#8217;s hands, and reached out to seize him.</p>

<p>Brunnoi was as slippery as an eel. He eluded Alexis&#8217; grasp and
darted through the door. Now without weapons, he took to his heels.</p>

<p>Hal perceived the flying apparition, and reached out a hand to
detain him. He clutched the flowing white beard of the bandit
chief&#8211;and the beard came away in his hand. Brunnoi fled down the
steps and made good his escape, Hal being too surprised to move.</p>

<p>Chester and Alexis were equally as astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; demanded Chester, in
great surprise. &#8220;A false beard! But I wonder how he escaped from
the firing squad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too deep for me,&#8221; Hal admitted. &#8220;But
we had better report this to the Grand Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they made their way to the quarters of the
commander-in-chief. The latter listened to their story with
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just learned of Brunnoi&#8217;s escape from the firing
squad,&#8221; he said when they had finished their account of their
experience with the bandit chief. &#8220;Count de Reslau, being a
Hungarian himself, was greatly interested in this Brunnoi. He asked me
for a pass to see him, I granted this request. The guards saw the count
leave the tent after a few moments&#8217; conversation. But when they
went in to lead Brunnoi forth to execution, he was gone, and another
man was there in his stead. He had exchanged places with
Brunnoi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you perfect confidence in Count de Reslau, Your
Excellency?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolute confidence,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No particular reason,&#8221; replied the lad.</p>

<p>At this moment Count de Reslau himself entered the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear Brunnoi has escaped,&#8221; was his first remark to
the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, that is true,&#8221; replied the Russian
commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; said the count. &#8220;When I talked to him a
couple of hours ago he seemed resigned to his fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;he paid these lads a
visit soon after his escape. Following a struggle, he again got
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The count glanced at the lads incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it ever occurred to Your Excellency,&#8221; he said
quietly, &#8220;that these two lads may know more about Brunnoi than
they care to admit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>Hal took a quick step forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he asked calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; replied the count with a
sneer.</p>

<p>He turned again to the Grand Duke. &#8220;Has it never occurred to
you, Your Excellency, that these boys may be associated with the
bandit&#8211;that they may have been leading you on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, but,&#8221; stammered the Grand Duke, &#8220;their
mission to the Carpathians. Their struggle to get away and their
flight. What of those?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mere fiction, I should say,&#8221; said the count with a
shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>Hal stepped directly in front of the count.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a lie,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>The count raised a hand as if to strike him, then thought better of
it and turned away without a word. Plainly the count&#8217;s words had
made an impression upon the Grand Duke. He looked at the two lads
closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you to say to that charge?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Chester, &#8220;except that it is too
absurd to be given credence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd,&#8221; sneered the count. &#8220;You brought the
bandit here in the first place, realizing that it would give you
standing with the Grand Duke, and knowing all the time that the way had
been paved for his escape. If you had no hand in his escape, how did
you know he had gotten away before coming here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came after us,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;and would have led
us away had it not been for Alexis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd,&#8221; said the count again and turned to the Grand
Duke. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how foolish that is. You
should have concocted a better story,&#8221; he added to Hal.</p>

<p>Now the Count de Reslau was one of the Grand Duke&#8217;s closest
friends, and, as the Duke had said, he had implicit confidence in him.
It was only natural, therefore, that he should be impressed with his
reasoning.</p>

<p>He advanced upon the two lads, and pointed an accusing finger at
each.</p>

<p>&#8220;The count is right!&#8221; he exclaimed in a loud voice.
&#8220;I can see it all! You are traitors! I would have sworn by your
honor in spite of the short time I have known you. You have rendered
me, I still believe, valuable service; but you have caused me to play
into the hands of the enemy in other matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; said Chester, stepping forward.
&#8220;Count de Reslau possibly means well, but he is badly mistaken.
His reasoning is at fault. We are innocent of this charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You deny it?&#8221; fairly shouted the Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they deny it,&#8221; said the count. &#8220;It is
hardly probable they would admit being traitors and spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand perfectly,&#8221; declared Nicholas as he
stepped to the door of his tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orderly,&#8221; he called, &#8220;summon the corporal and ten
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped back into the tent and turned upon the two lads
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall see how we treat traitors in Russia,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>An officer and ten men now strode into the tent. The Grand Duke
waved his hands toward the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take them out and shoot them immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer advanced toward the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency!&#8221; exclaimed Hal, stepping forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; cried the Grand Duke. &#8220;I will be trifled
with no longer. Officer, do your duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>The guards surrounded the boys, and they were marched from the
tent.</p>

<p>Count de Reslau smiled to himself as they were led away, and turned
to the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go out and watch the proceedings,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed the Grand Duke, and they hurried
after the firing squad and the prisoners.</p>

<p>The lads stood facing their would-be executioners when the Grand
Duke and Count de Reslau appeared. At that moment, Hal felt something
in his pocket that gave him a sudden thrill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to take one last chance,&#8221; he said to
Chester. To the Duke he called: &#8220;Your Excellency, may I make a
last request?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke nodded an assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say once more, Your Excellency,&#8221; said Hal,
&#8220;that we are innocent. But,&#8221; he paused, &#8220;I can
produce Brunnoi himself!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE MYSTERY CLEARED.</span></h2>

<p>Chester stared in astonishment at his friend. Had he gone mad and
taken this means of staying their execution?</p>

<p>The Grand Duke staggered back a step, and Count de Reslau smiled
incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I your permission to do so, Your Excellency?&#8221;
asked Hal.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have three minutes to produce him,&#8221; he said
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;It will require even
less.&#8221;</p>

<p>His right hand was in his pocket. Suddenly it flashed forth, and
with it something white. Straight toward Count de Reslau the lad
sprang, and before the latter could leap out of the way Hal grasped him
firmly by the back of the neck with his left hand, and with his right
clapped a long, flowing white beard to his face. Then with a twist, he
whirled him so that he faced the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold Brunnoi, chief of the bandits!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke staggered back again, and put one hand to his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>But he was forced to believe what his eyes saw. Count de Reslau and
Brunnoi, the bandit chief, were one and the same man. There could be no
doubt of that.</p>

<p>In vain did the bandit struggle to free himself from Hal&#8217;s
firm grasp. The lad clung to him tightly in spite of all his efforts.
Then, realizing that the Grand Duke must be convinced, he dropped the
beard to the ground and stepped back while half a dozen rifles covered
the count.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke, with a wave of his arm, instructed the officer in
command of the firing squad to release the two lads. Then he ordered
him to conduct the bandit chief to his quarters, and motioned the lads
to follow. Inside the tent the Grand Duke turned upon his false
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Reslau,&#8221; he said, addressing the prisoner, &#8220;we
have been friends, and for that reason I am offering you a chance to
make a satisfactory explanation&#8211;if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say,&#8221; replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me how you have conducted your
operations?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bandit did not reply and Hal stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe I can
rehearse it from beginning to end. The count probably will correct me
if I am wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke ordered him to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;the count knew of our mission.
We went horseback, but the count, being prepared for these rapid
journeys, proceeded by automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bandit chief glanced at the lad in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We stumbled upon your automobile garage in the
mountains,&#8221; said Hal quietly. &#8220;Of course, when we returned,
the count was waiting for us. Why he left us behind alive when he came
back here, I don&#8217;t know, but I now remember how greatly surprised
the count was to see us back safely. Immediately he planned to get us
out of the way. Hence the attack the other night, in which we were
fortunate enough to capture him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the escape?&#8221; demanded the Grand Duke. &#8220;How
did he escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very simple,&#8221; replied Hal. &#8220;The man to whom you
gave the pass to see the prisoner was of course not Count de Reslau,
but a man made up to resemble him. Am I right, count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the bandit. &#8220;I have kept him near
me for that very purpose. He had his orders that in the event I was
ever arrested, he would make up to resemble me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; continued Hal. &#8220;Once alone with the
prisoner the rest was easy. He removed his disguise, and Brunnoi
removed his. Brunnoi came out as Count de Reslau, and the other man
stayed. Naturally, the first thing the count thought of when he was
free was to dispose of Chester and myself. Hence his call this morning.
As he escaped from Alexis I succeeded in pulling off his beard.
That&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; demanded the bandit chief, &#8220;what are
you going to do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one thing I can do with you,&#8221; replied the
Grand Duke. &#8220;The fate of Count de Reslau shall be the same as
that already pronounced for Brunnoi, the bandit. You shall be shot
within the hour. Personal friendship shall not keep me from doing my
duty. Officer, see that my command is carried out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guard closed in about Count de Reslau and he was led away. Then
the Grand Duke Nicholas, commander-in-chief of the Russian armies, sank
into a chair, and buried his face in his arms on the table. Quietly the
lads left the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Chester, as they walked along,
&#8220;you spotted de Reslau just in time. Another moment and it would
have been too late. Tell me, how did you happen to hit it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since I pulled Brunnoi&#8217;s beard off this
morning,&#8221; replied Hal, &#8220;another face has kept flashing into
my mind. I could not make it out clearly until just as we stood before
the firing squad. Then I saw it as plain as day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for us that you did,&#8221; said Chester
with enthusiasm. &#8220;But here comes Alexis. He&#8217;ll be glad to
know that Brunnoi has been disposed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you make much over a small matter,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Small matter!&#8221; exclaimed Chester. &#8220;I should say
that proving Brunnoi and Count de Reslau were one and the same person
was quite a big matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had asked me,&#8221; returned Alexis calmly, &#8220;I
could have told you that several days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could?&#8221; cried both lads in a single voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I knew it right along. You see, my eyes are
unusually keen. I remember once how this keen sight proved of great
advantage. We were on a raid. The officer in command, using his
glasses, could not quite make out objects moving some miles away. He
called upon me. My eyes, being far more powerful than the glass, showed
me plainly what was going on, and we were thus kept from falling into a
trap. Then I remember another case&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One is enough,&#8221; said Hal dryly. &#8220;If you knew
Brunnoi and Count de Reslau were the same person, why didn&#8217;t you
say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Alexis in no wise disconcerted, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t see that it made any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your sight is not so good after all,&#8221; said
Chester. &#8220;But what are we going to do now, Hal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;I guess we might as well go get
Marquis and return to our regiment. Our work here is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog was indeed glad to accompany his three friends forth once
more, and so, procuring three fiery chargers, the trio set out to
rejoin their regiment at the front&#8211;some miles to the west of the
city of Lodz.</p>

<p>Most of the officers of the regiment to which the three were
attached had been killed in the previous battle, and so when they
finally reached it, Alexis found that instead of being a lieutenant he
had become a captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he told the boys confidentially, &#8220;a
brave man always comes into his own. You will see how these fellows
fight with me at their head. They will be a whole lot different, I can
tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Russians had intrenched themselves along the entire front, as
had the Germans only a short distance away. During the days in which
the lads had been in the midst of the Carpathians, there had been only
skirmishing between the opposing forces. Long range artillery duels
raged incessantly; but there had been little work for the cavalry and
infantry.</p>

<p>There had of course been several charges and counter charges, but
the advantage rested with neither side. The Russian troops, in spite of
the cold weather, made themselves comfortable in the trenches, wrapped
to the chin in their heavy sheepskin garments. Used to severe winter
weather, the Russian troops did not fare as badly as did the Germans,
who suffered severely.</p>

<p>The lads&#8217; regiment was stationed near the center of the long
line of battle. Preparations for a movement of some sort were being
made on all sides. Troops were being hurried here and there, and
officers dashed hither and yon. Occasionally the men burst into song;
while from the German trenches came the chanting of the &#8220;Watch on
the Rhine.&#8221; The men of both armies were making the best of the
situation, and seemed reasonably happy.</p>

<p>From his pocket one of the Russian officers now produced a pack of
cards. Alexis, invited to take a hand, consented, but Hal and Chester
refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded the officer.
&#8220;Are you too good to play cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; smiled Hal. &#8220;We simply don&#8217;t
care to play, that&#8217;s all. We do play occasionally, for pastime,
but we don&#8217;t gamble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t gamble!&#8221; exclaimed the officer. &#8220;How
can you play cards if you don&#8217;t gamble. Come on now, we need two
more players.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hal, decidedly. &#8220;We shall have to ask
you to excuse us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Alexis glanced at the lads in astonishment. Plainly this was
beyond his comprehension, as gambling among the Cossacks is an ordinary
pastime. But the other officer was not satisfied. He arose and came
directly up to Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must play with us,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; replied Hal, &#8220;but we do not care to
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid, eh?&#8221; said the Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Hal, &#8220;we are not afraid. We simply
don&#8217;t care to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cowards,&#8221; said the Russian, and jostled Hal
with his shoulder.</p>

<p>Hal stood his ground and refused to be pushed aside. The Russian
reached out a thumb and finger and pulled Hal&#8217;s nose. Then he
staggered back, for Hal had sent his fist crashing against his
chest.</p>

<p>Quickly the Russian officer drew his sword and sprang upon the lad,
who also drew his weapon and stood on guard. But now Alexis leaped to
his feet, and his own sword struck up the weapons of the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this,&#8221; he said sternly. &#8220;Put up your
swords.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no desire to fight,&#8221; replied Hal calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t,&#8221; sneered the Russian.
&#8220;You are afraid. But I demand satisfaction for that
blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Alexis, &#8220;if you must fight, let it be
with fists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any way suits me,&#8221; said the Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he insists on a fight, I am willing to give it to
him,&#8221; said Hal, and quickly threw off his coat.</p>

<p>The Russian also discarded his heavy coat, and the two squared off.
It was perfectly plain to Hal that the Russian, although considerably
larger than himself, was no boxer, and he had little doubt of the
outcome, for the lad was proficient in the use of his fists.</p>

<p>The Russian came forward with a rush. Hal sidestepped neatly, and
the huge fist passed by harmlessly. Hal sent a quick sharp blow to the
Russian&#8217;s cheek, staggering him a bit. The latter turned and
again rushed at the lad.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd had now collected around the combatants and watched
the contest eagerly. As the Russian rushed at him this time, Hal struck
up the blow with his left forearm, and stepping in close planted his
right over his opponent&#8217;s heart. The Russian staggered back, and
at the same time Hal sent a series of left and right jabs to his
opponent&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>But the Russian, recovering, bored in again, striking out wildly at
the lad. The latter gave a clever exhibition of footwork, and not a
single blow landed. At the same time he continued to tap the Russian
lightly on either side of the face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Russian lowered his hands and stepped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I quit,&#8221; he said, smiling foolishly. &#8220;There is no
use trying to hit a man when he runs away all the time. Now with swords
or pistols&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no swords or pistols used while I am here to
prevent it,&#8221; exclaimed Alexis.</p>

<p>At that very instant the clear call of a bugle sounded in the
Russian trenches. Quickly all personal animosities were forgotten, and
the men sprang to their posts.</p>

<p>It was the signal for an advance.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE ATTACK.</span></h2>

<p>The reconnoitering cavalry of the advancing forces gave way to
groups of infantry, scattered in loose formation, feeling their way
toward the German trenches. The points and small flanking parties of
the advance guards, in front of each column of advance, crept along
with straining eyes in search of the enemy&#8217;s line of
observation.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards to the rearward the supports advanced alertly,
ready to scatter into a thin line of skirmishers at the first shot and
rush ahead to where the points halted. In the rear of them the infantry
columns, with one rumble of artillery close to the front, moved and
halted, as the thin line to the front paused for a moment to scan
ahead, then pushed on again.</p>

<p>Out of the stillness of the dew-dripping woods in front, the shot
came. There was no reply for a moment, then two or three closer reports
rang loud in reply; then there came another pause, and as the hurrying
supports deployed and flung themselves behind the nearest cover, in
momentary scanning before pushing ahead to investigate decisively,
there came a short, ragged volley from out ahead.</p>

<p>The reports were flat and dull, as a rule, but a few cracked
viciously as though fired close at hand. These last followed the vacuum
of low-flying bullets and had a spat and twang of their own.</p>

<p>For weeks these two armies had been facing each other; for a week
assault had wrestled with counter assault and the armies had striven
time after time to snatch an advantage from a massing of columns, or a
seeming check.</p>

<p>For miles to right and left, every road, every footpath, every few
yards of broken ground was trodden by the feet of short columns,
prepared to charge into lines at the needed moment, when the fire of
the enemy became a menace. The trenches were abandoned in the rear, yet
should the columns in the rear, which by the heads formed a long, long
line of supports, be hurled back in repulse after an unsuccessful
attack, the trenches would be greeted as comfortable old friends and
reoccupied.</p>

<p>The leading columns deployed into thin lines, with short intervals
between the men, as the shrapnel broke. From out the blur of the
mingling of landscape and sky there came, simultaneously, a whir, a
crash, and the quick dash of shrapnel balls over the ground, and of the
brief flash which marked the shrapnel&#8217;s burst there remained only
a dimly-seen lingering cloud of dirty smoke and some silent, writhing
forms on the ground.</p>

<p>Then came crash after crash, as the hostile artillery opened in
strength. The silence of the morning fled into a hideous din as the
infantry broke into a dog trot and pushed ahead.</p>

<p>There came a clank of trace chains and the pounding of hoofs
mingling with hoarse commands as the artillery of the Russians wheeled
out of column to position in battery, the ring of hastily-opened
breechblocks, the hollow thump of the blocks closing and the shrill
notes of a silvery whistle. Then the earth began to tremble.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt after thunderbolt seemed to be discharging close in the
rear, until the very trees shook and men swayed under the compression
of air in the vicinity. Over the heads of the silent infantry, shrapnel
shrieked in reply, one after another, as the batteries opened with
salvos from flank to flank.</p>

<p>Through the gaps between the belching batteries poured the infantry,
the columns dashing forward until, beneath the trajectory of the guns,
it was safe to spread out in the always thin line of the infantry
advance. The leading lines pushed on till they disappeared in the yet
dim light, and at a short distance behind them came others, until it
seemed that the end would never come, and that a hurrying city was
passing.</p>

<p>Ahead, the leading infantry line, absorbing the scattered men of the
first light contact line, halted at command under the mounting rifle
fire of the enemy, halted and flung itself prone, while ready hands
reached backward for intrenching tools, and the line scraped, clawed,
scooped and burrowed into the fresh earth in shallow pits, and went
about its business of returning the German fire.</p>

<p>Then a second thin line ran up and merged with the first. Again
shovel and small mattock came into play and the volume of fire
redoubled. Above the cracking of the rifles the only sounds to be heard
were the sharp whistles of the officers. They shrilled in a variety of
notes and combinations, yet with an understood speech of their own, for
in parts of the line the fire slackened and two or three men left their
shelter and crept forward a few paces; or, crouching down low, dashed
ahead until the whistles spoke again.</p>

<p>Intrenching tool again; then fire. That was the order of the
advance. More men crept or rushed to the new position to dig themselves
into the ground and open fire, until the entire line had advanced a few
yards under the hostile shots and a new line occupied the shelter
trenches recently abandoned.</p>

<p>Here and there lay quiet forms across the path of advance. The hardy
bodies in the well-fitting uniforms seemed pitilessly small and their
clothing hung in baggy folds. Their comrades passed them by with hardly
a glance. The litter sections were far to the rear, for their time was
not yet. Duty called for assault, not for succor.</p>

<p>The thunder of the contending batteries continued. Over the hastily
carved trenches the hostile shrapnel scorched their way, singing along
with a note of wild rage, searching the crevasses and folds of the
ground and scoring the earth.</p>

<p>But the Russian infantry still advanced.</p>

<p>Quietly filling the gaps that had grown in the firing line since the
attack commenced, the supporting lines came to the front. Each
accession of reënforcements seemed to give an added impetus to the
forward movement, for upon the arrival of each fresh contingent the
line surged ahead like breakers on a coast, and, like the incoming
tide, each surge left its mark higher upon the strand.</p>

<p>With a calmness which bespoke experience, despite the light of
battle which blazed in their eyes, the new men brought and distributed
fresh bandoliers of ammunition to those who had gone before, then took
their places alongside to aid in its expenditure. The lines were not
straight. They zigzagged a trifle. There was no time for chalk-mark
adjustment or inspection, and the moment a panting body struck the
ground after a forward rush, the earth began to fly on the spot beneath
the chop of the trench-digging tools, and the hot rifles to speak.</p>

<p>Men growled, muttered and shouted. Under the fighting fog that beset
each one in its own way, there came snatches of song, humming and
whistling. There were those, too, who fought silently, as though deeply
wrapped in thought, and there was bickering when a hasty comrade
crowded too close for free operation of the flying breechbolts; yet the
faces were ever turned to the front, except when they turned to the sky
or the earth, and nerveless hands fell sprawling with half-emptied
rifles.</p>

<p>Where officers, binoculars in hand, bent hastily to the line, men
detached themselves at intervals, and clawing at their belts, seized
the wire cutters pendant there and crawled forward. Now and then one of
the creeping ones would spring into the air and topple over, but the
rest, apparently paying no heed, continued on their way toward where
the Germans had erected wire entanglements to hold the stormers under
the blast of the enemy&#8217;s fire.</p>

<p>Ahead, the trenches of the Germans crackled and spat with fury, and
even under the ceaseless rain of shrapnel from above the assaulting
lines the enemy kept his place. The firing line had thickened until it
was a solid mass, one man deep, and in the rear line after line had
sprung to its feet and was closing up in support to the crucial
assault. At the trenches of the defenders, batteries, with horses
falling and being cut away in an instant, dashed to the line,
unlimbered and poured in their scattering salutations of zero shrapnel
to the men in front.</p>

<p>Came a clank and rattle of bayonets snapped onto the muzzles of the
assaulting line; then, with a last frenzied emptying of magazines, the
lines sprang to foot, and with hoarse voices screeching at top note,
the slender line charged forward.</p>

<p>The trenches were lined with the defenders in an instant. The rifle
fire redoubled in intensity and the artillery, which had come up to
stem the tide, or assault when the supporting batteries of the attack
were compelled to hold their fire for fear of obliterating their own
attacking lines, barked at four-second intervals, opening great gaps in
the racing line at every discharge.</p>

<p>In rear of the supporting lines of the assault, which were closing
up at a dead run, galloped the batteries which were to make a rallying
point in case the assault failed, or occupy the trenches, should the
defenders be driven out, and the cannoneers clutched the side rails as
the pieces swayed and rocked across the rough ground and clustered
bodies which strewed the field.</p>

<p>At the crest of the parapet the lines, attack and defense met with a
ring of steel. Bayonets flashed, darted, parried and struck. Rifle
butts whirled above bare heads and the stocks crashed down through bone
and flesh. From both sides came a rain of hand grenades, bombs which
exploded upon touch. From the rear of the trenches there came running
formed troops, to assist in the repulse of the Russians, and as the
supporting lines of the attack threw themselves into the fray, the
whirling, struggling, fighting lines on the trenches&#8217; top
thickened and swayed.</p>

<p>The line sagged, bulged, trembled, and broke in huge gaps. Into the
splaying breaches there rushed fresh troops from front and rear, and
the lines thickened and swayed again. Men discarded their arms to lock
in one another&#8217;s embrace, fighting to the last.</p>

<p>The din was deafening, yet above it there rang out the detonation
and shock of a great explosion, where a delayed mine belched upward
under the pressure of the hastening troops coming up with the attacking
reserve. Earth, stones, wire entanglements, arms and men shot upward in
a dense geyser of death, and came down in the midst of the fierce
fighting.</p>

<p>Then the line broke again, and the shattered reserves of the attack,
summoning the last resources, poured into the breach with bayonet and
magazine.</p>

<p>The defense gave way.</p>

<p>Crumpled under the last despairing hurling of last reserves, the
entrenched line shuddered along its length, then the line lost its
cohesion, stood irresolute for a moment, then fled precipitately to the
rear.</p>

<p>The whistles of the Russian officers blew again and again. Officers
had fallen until corporals and sergeants commanded platoons and
companies; yet they, too, had their whistles and knew their duties; and
out of the scramble of the attack, regardless of company, regiment or
brigade, the Russians fell into rough line, knelt, and opened fire upon
the routed enemy, while the supporting batteries dashed to the
trenches, unlimbered and belched fire and iron into the fleeing
mass.</p>

<p>The standards of the Russians, which had changed hands a dozen
times, during the course of the assault, were planted on the works; the
troops themselves, exhausted and spent by the might and fury of their
efforts, threw themselves into tired heaps as other brigades came up to
hold the position.</p>

<p>The trenches were won!</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE DEATH OF A FRIEND.</span></h2>

<p>Hal, Chester and Alexis had been in the midst of the fray, where the
fighting was the thickest. Not in the first line of attack, they had
advanced with the first reserves. And beside them, snapping, biting and
snarling, strode Marquis.</p>

<p>Now the herculean prowess of the giant Cossack stood them all in
good stead. More than once Hal or Chester would have gone down, or been
trampled under foot by the troops behind, had not the quick eye of
Alexis signaled out their danger and his powerful arm come to their
aid. Guarding himself perfectly from the sword and bayonet thrusts of
the enemy, after the fighting became hand to hand, the Cossack fought
like a madman, as did others of his race, hurling himself upon his foes
with almost superhuman ferocity.</p>

<p>For the first time the two lads had the experience of digging
trenches as they advanced upon the enemy, and in spite of the fact that
they were officers, they did not shirk the work. Just before reaching
the parapet, the first line of reserves&#8211;to which the friends were
attached&#8211;joined the original first line and sprang into the
trenches together.</p>

<p>There they fought with desperation. Not a word was exchanged between
them, although they fought side by side. There was no time for
conversation. The press was too thick, and death too near.</p>

<p>But now that the Germans had turned to flee, the Russians sent up a
wild cry of triumph. Hal, Chester and Alexis rested upon their weapons,
watching the troops pour a hail of lead into the flying foe. Marquis
advanced several paces ahead of the farthest Russian troops, stood up
on his hind legs and let out a bark of joy. Bullets flew around him,
and Chester, realizing the dog&#8217;s danger, whistled sharply.
Marquis turned and wagged his tail at his friend, and opened his mouth
in one more joyful bark.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that a German bullet struck him. Without a
sound the noble animal crumpled up and fell to the ground. The ball had
pierced his throat. But life was not extinct. Marquis struggled to his
feet, and dragged himself toward Hal and Chester, who, having seen him
fall, dashed toward him.</p>

<p>Gently Chester lifted Marquis&#8217; heavy weight up in his arms,
holding him so that the blood would not flow so rapidly from the gaping
wound in his throat. Marquis looked up into the lad&#8217;s face, and
uttered a low, painful bark. His tail wagged.</p>

<p>Quickly the lads hurried back to Alexis and as quickly sought out a
surgeon. Chester laid Marquis gently on the ground, and the surgeon
bent over him. After a brief examination he arose and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No hope,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;The bullet pierced
his jugular vein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there something you can do?&#8221; pleaded
Chester, tears streaming down his face.</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said, and hurried away.</p>

<p>Chester picked Marquis up again, and followed by Hal and Alexis,
made his way toward the rear, where the troops were more scattered, and
where there was none to bother them. Hal drew off his coat, and Chester
laid the dog on it.</p>

<p>Marquis did not whimper. He, as well as his three friends, seemed to
know that death was not far off, and he was prepared to meet the end
bravely, as a soldier-dog should. He turned slightly and licked
Chester&#8217;s hand that lay upon his head. Chester patted him gently,
but he was beyond words.</p>

<p>Alexis extended a huge hand and softly stroked the dog&#8217;s soft
body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p>Marquis&#8217; keen ears caught these words, and he turned feebly
toward the giant Cossack, and strained slightly toward him. At the same
time he slowly raised a paw. Chester saw the movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to shake hands with you, Alexis,&#8221; he said
brokenly.</p>

<p>The giant drew nearer, and gravely took Marquis&#8217; right paw in
his great hand. Once, twice, three times he shook it gently, then laid
it upon the ground and turned away. Marquis moved restlessly, and
uttered a short bark. He was trying to see Hal, who was kneeling behind
him.</p>

<p>Hal arose and came around. To him also Marquis extended his paw, and
Hal grasped it and pressed it. Then, shifting his position slightly,
the dog also extended the paw to Chester. He seemed to know well that
the end was swiftly approaching, and he wished to shake hands with all
his friends before he passed away.</p>

<p>Now the three gathered about the head of their dying friend. Alexis
clenched his great fists and spoke to Marquis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see that you are avenged,&#8221; he said fiercely.
&#8220;Twenty German lives will not pay for this day&#8217;s work, but
I&#8217;ll do the best I can. Do you understand, Marquis?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marquis&#8217; tail beat a weak tattoo upon the ground, and he
barked feebly. He understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; said Alexis. &#8220;You may rest
assured of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the end was fast approaching. Marquis&#8217; breath came in
quick gasps. Suddenly he staggered to his feet, stood upright a second,
turned his face toward the distant enemy, and gave utterance to one
sharp bark&#8211;a bark of defiance. Then he sank to the ground.</p>

<p>His three friends dropped to their knees and bent over him. He
looked up into their faces and it seemed to all that he smiled at them.
His tail struck the ground feebly, once, twice. He shook once with a
silent convulsion. Then his body straightened out and stiffened. He lay
still.</p>

<p>Marquis was dead.</p>

<p>His three friends rose slowly to their feet, and lifted their caps
from their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Marquis!&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;But he died as a
soldier should!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;and with almost his last
breath he breathed defiance to the Germans, whom he hated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a better or braver soldier in the Russian
army,&#8221; said Alexis. &#8220;We must bury him with
honors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall!&#8221; cried Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am somewhat handy with a knife,&#8221; said Alexis.
&#8220;I shall carve him a little monument.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he shall be laid to rest with full military
honors,&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>And so it was done.</p>

<p>All that day Alexis worked upon the little monument. When it was
finally completed, all was in readiness for the burial. The dog had
made friends in the regiment. Not a man but had become attached to him;
and so it was no small funeral cortege that escorted the body of the
dog-hero to his last resting place.</p>

<p>From the quartermaster Chester had secured a large French flag.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall be buried beneath his own flag,&#8221; he said, and
spreading the tricolor upon the ground, he laid the stiffened body of
Marquis upon it.</p>

<p>Gently he wrapped it about the dog, and then, while practically the
whole regiment stood at attention around the little grave, he placed
the body in the ground and stepped back. A volley was fired over the
grave, and the lads shoveled in the earth.</p>

<p>Now Alexis approached, and, making a small hole at the head of the
grave, set up the little monument. And when he had finished, the
soldiers crowded around to read the epitaph that the giant Cossack had
inscribed in the hard wood. It was this:</p>

<p>&#8220;Marquis&#8211;killed on the field of honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was upon the following day that the welcome news came that there
was to be further action. Practically every Cossack regiment at the
front in Poland was ordered back to Lodz, their places being taken by
other Russian cavalry and infantry.</p>

<p>Again in Lodz the lads learned what this new movement meant. Grand
Duke Nicholas, the investment of Galicia having been successful, had
decided upon an immediate invasion of Hungary. The Cossacks had been
called to lead the dash over the Carpathians into the heart of the
enemy&#8217;s territory.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester had an audience of the Grand Duke. The latter
summoned them to his quarters to offer an apology for his hasty action
in ordering them shot some days before. Also he talked a little of the
proposed invasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty thousand Cossack cavalry will be the advance
guard,&#8221; he informed them. &#8220;Behind these will come the
infantry in great force. I plan to have a million men in Hungary within
two months. If we are successful in forcing a passage of the mountains,
and I am sure we shall be, Budapest will be at our mercy, with Vienna
as the next goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime the Poland campaign will be pressed, that the
Germans may be unable to go to the aid of the Austrians in the south.
The thing that I fear now is that Turkey may be drawn into the war on
the side of the German emperor. The Kaiser has brought great pressure
to bear upon them, and I fear that they cannot long be kept
neutral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What effect would that have upon the invasion of
Hungary?&#8221; questioned Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would unquestionably delay it for days, possibly weeks.
While we are prepared for the Turks, nevertheless it would probably
necessitate the sending of reënforcements toward the border, and
naturally I should have to draw upon the forces I am now sending into
Hungary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Chester. &#8220;But the Turk, as a
fighting man, doesn&#8217;t amount to much, as I understand
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the recent Balkan war they did not show much fighting
prowess, it is true,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;but officered
by Germans, and under German discipline, there may be a different story
to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is no danger of their affecting the ultimate
outcome of the war?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; was the confident reply. &#8220;What it will
mean, however, is that Turkey, as a nation, will be wiped off the map
of Europe, and, possibly, of Asia also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better,&#8221; was Hal&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may take time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it will be done
just so surely as Turkey casts in her fortunes with Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some further talk the lads left the Grand Duke&#8217;s tent,
and rejoined their regiment. Everything was now practically ready for
the advance to the southward, and the troops were eagerly awaiting the
word that was to send them into the Carpathians, to strike a decisive
blow at the Austrians.</p>

<p>And the word was given early the following morning.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br /><span
class='fss'>RAIDING.</span></h2>

<p>At a fierce gallop the troop of Cossacks bore down upon the little
mountain town&#8211;firing at a detachment of Austrian soldiers who
ventured forth to give them battle&#8211;without checking their speed.
This band of Cossacks, reconnoitering well ahead of the main advance
guard, was probably 1,000 strong; the Austrians opposing them much
less. With the rapidly advancing Russians were Hal, Chester and
Alexis.</p>

<p>The advance of the Czar&#8217;s troops to the Carpathians had been
without incident. Whenever troops of the enemy had opposed them they
had been put to flight without difficulty. The cavalry, dashing rapidly
ahead, had outdistanced their cavalry and artillery support, and the
entire force of mounted men&#8211;60,000 of them&#8211;were in the
midst of the wild mountains.</p>

<p>Harassed from front and, now that they had advanced well into the
mountains, also from the sides and rear, the Cossacks nevertheless
pushed on. From behind rocks and trees, isolated bands of Austrians
fired upon them, doing great execution, disappearing in the hills when
the Cossacks turned upon them.</p>

<p>The reconnoitering force to which the lads were attached dashed down
upon the little mountain town, the sun gleaming on their lances and
revolver barrels. In vain did the Austrian officers urge their men to
stand firm. After one volley at the approaching horsemen, they broke
and fled, scattering in all directions. The very name, Cossack, spread
terror.</p>

<p>Right into the middle of the little village dashed the troop. Now
from every window came a hail of lead, and the Cossacks, apparently
trapped, turned this way and that, not knowing which way to go. Struck
by a rifle bullet, the officer in command threw up his hands and
toppled from his horse. Quickly Alexis sprang to the head of the men,
Hal and Chester beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dismount!&#8221; cried Alexis.</p>

<p>The cavalrymen threw themselves from their horses, and at a second
command, rushed directly upon the houses. With heavy kicks they smashed
in the doors and rushed upon the occupants within. They soon put an end
to these snipers.</p>

<p>But now, around one side of the town appeared a troop of Austrian
horse.</p>

<p>Hal raised a cry of warning, and quickly the Cossacks turned and
leaped upon their own horses; but the Austrian cavalry had no mind to
give battle to their foes, and after pouring in a volley, turned and
fled down the narrow mountain pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;After them!&#8221; cried Alexis.</p>

<p>He put spurs to his horse and dashed ahead, his men following
closely.</p>

<p>The Austrians had not gone far when their leader called a halt and
consulted with his subordinate officer. They were, the leader knew, not
far from a point where he could expect reënforcements.</p>

<p>A plan was quickly formed. The Austrians divided into two parts. The
foremost blocked the road&#8211;down which the Cossacks were rapidly
approaching&#8211;near a turn, so as to remain unseen by the
approaching enemy until almost the moment of contact. The second force
stayed some rods behind the first, forming in two lines, one along each
side of the road. Some were armed with lances and sabers, but many also
carried rifles.</p>

<p>As for the Cossacks, all carried lances and revolvers.</p>

<p>The Russians went forward at a gallop. Alexis was expecting to
overtake the enemy, but he was hardly prepared for the suddenness of
the encounter.</p>

<p>Ere he could give an order, there came one loud, flaming, whistling
discharge from that living barrier drawn up across the road.
Alexis&#8217; horse reared, as did others of the troop. Some of the men
came to a quick stop, others were borne forward by the impetus of their
former speed, but reined in for orders. No man fell, though one groaned
and two hurled epithets at the foe.</p>

<p>Alexis, now that he had his horse under control, drew his sword with
his right hand, his pistol with his left, which also held the rein, and
ordered his men to charge, to fire at the moment of contact, then to
cut, slash and club.</p>

<p>The first line of Austrians, as soon as they had fired, retreated
between the two lines of supports, stopping at some further distance to
reform. The second line, being thus cleared of the first, poured a hail
of bullets into the Cossacks as the latter were caught between
them.</p>

<p>Many fell, but the others turned on the second barrier with furious
force, some, however, rushing upon the reforming first line.</p>

<p>They were the best riders in the world, and many a one of them held
his lance aloft in one hand, his revolver raised in the other, the rein
loose on his horse&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>The Austrians and Alexis&#8217; foremost men fired at the same
moment. The Austrians had not time to turn and flee, for the Cossacks,
unchecked by this second greeting of fire, came on at headlong
speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;At &#8217;em, boys!&#8221; cried Hal excitedly, firing his
revolver at a tall Austrian officer, who fell sidewise from his
horse.</p>

<p>An Austrian officer struck with a sword at Chester&#8217;s left arm,
but only knocked the pistol from his hand. The lad found himself
threatened on the right by a trooper, and slashed at him with his
sword. The blow went home, but the sword&#8217;s end became entangled
with the victim&#8217;s breast knot. A second trooper brought his rifle
butt down heavily upon the sword, and it snapped off.</p>

<p>Chester felt a keen smart in his left leg. It came from a second
sword blow aimed by the Austrian officer, who might have followed it
with a third, but that he was now attacked elsewhere. Chester had no
sooner clapped his hand to his wounded leg than he was stunned by a
blow from the rifle butt of the trooper who had previously struck the
sword. He fell forward on his horse&#8217;s neck, which he grasped
madly with both arms.</p>

<p>Still holding the broken sword in his right hand, Chester now lapsed
from a sense of the tumult, the plunging and shrieking horses, the whir
and clash of swords, the thuds of rifle blows, into half consciousness,
while the unguided horse turned suddenly and made off in the direction
from which he had come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cossacks had been pushing the Austrians back. Hal and
Alexis, fighting side by side, were so far unharmed. Right into the
midst of the enemy they plunged, and for several minutes could see
nothing but flying swords and lances. Then, at a signal, the Austrians
turned and fled.</p>

<p>Hal turned to speak to Chester, but the latter was not there. In
alarm, he called Alexis&#8217; attention to the fact that Chester was
missing. Quickly Alexis ordered a halt and looked around. Bodies
strewed the road, and leaping from their horses, the two investigated.
Chester was not there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; exclaimed Hal. &#8220;What can have
happened to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis questioned his men. One remembered that a great black charger
had dashed through the troop in the midst of the battle and had fled to
the rear. He remembered that a form was upon the animal&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been Chester,&#8221; said Hal to Alexis.
&#8220;Do you go on in pursuit of the Austrians, and I will go back and
see if I can find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Alexis. &#8220;The horse probably will run
back to the main column. You should not have much trouble finding
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a word of command Alexis ordered the troop ahead, and Hal
started back on the trail of his chum.</p>

<p>When Chester was again aware of things he was still clasping the
horse&#8217;s neck and was being borne along he knew not whither. His
head ached and his left leg pained him greatly. He was dizzy and too
weak to raise himself from his position. He could not hear any sound of
fighting. He tried to sit up and look around, but this added to his
pain, so he fell forward on the neck of his horse again.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horse stopped.</p>

<p>Once more Chester tried to sit up. This time he was successful, and
in spite of the pain glanced about him. The horse had halted near a
little house, set back some fifty feet from the road, and even as he
looked up a woman came from the doorway. She started in astonishment at
the sight of the horse and its wounded rider, and hastened back into
the house. She reappeared in a moment, however, accompanied by a second
woman, the latter armed with a huge revolver.</p>

<p>The two now approached the lad and lifted him from the horse. They
supported him as he dragged himself into the house, and dropped weakly
into a chair. Then the women stepped back and pointed the revolver at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall remain here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;until I can
turn you over to the Austrians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester was somewhat surprised. By the assistance given him by the
women, he had thought that, after resting up, he would be allowed to
rejoin his friends; but the set expression on the woman&#8217;s face
told the lad that she meant what she said.</p>

<p>The second woman approached with water and bandages and soon bound
up his wounds. Then the lad was escorted to another room, which looked
out upon the road. The woman mounted guard over him with her
revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of our troops will be here before long,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;Until then I shall guard you.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time Chester retained his hold on the broken sword.
Suddenly, down the road, came the sound of a galloping horse. Chester
glanced through the window and in a moment he had made out the figure
of Hal. Quickly he stepped to the window, and before his captor could
prevent him, shattered the window pane with his broken sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal!&#8221; he cried at the top of his voice. &#8220;Hal!
Here I am, wounded and a prisoner!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman hurled herself upon the lad and bore him back out of
sight. In his weakened condition he was no match for her. She thrust
him back into the chair. He turned his eyes to the window. Hal had
passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; ejaculated Chester. &#8220;He
didn&#8217;t hear me!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hal had heard. He recognized the sound of his friend&#8217;s
voice, and realized that he was in trouble of some kind. Likewise he
surmised what the trouble was, for he knew that they were in the heart
of a hostile country. Therefore, he did not check the speed of his
horse at once, but rode some distance further before drawing rein. Then
he dismounted and tied his horse to a sapling.</p>

<p>Springing in among the trees, he advanced cautiously toward the
house. Both women, secure in the belief that he had passed on, turned
to taunt Chester. The latter shut his lips grimly and refused to make a
reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the next room, came a tremendous clattering of pots
and pans.</p>

<p>Both women jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is someone out there!&#8221; cried one of the women
excitedly.</p>

<p>With her revolver pointed straight before her she moved softly
toward the door. At the same moment Chester realized Hal&#8217;s ruse
and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Hal!&#8221;</p>

class='fss'>AT BAY IN THE PASS.</span></h2>

<p>When Hal, after creeping into the house through a window, had
inadvertently bumped into several pots and pans, knocking them to the
floor with a clatter, he drew his revolver and stood stockstill. He
heard Chester&#8217;s cry of warning, and, realizing that an enemy was
approaching, he drew a bead upon the doorway.</p>

<p>An arm with a pistol appeared through the opening; there was a flash
of fire and a bullet sped past him. He fired quickly in return, and the
weapon of his unseen enemy dropped to the floor with a crash, followed
by a shrill scream of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, a woman!&#8221; cried Hal and leaped
forward.</p>

<p>But the woman was more frightened than hurt. Realizing that she was
uninjured, as Hal came toward her, she leaped forward and threw her
arms about him, pinioning the lad&#8217;s hand that held his revolver
to his side. At the same moment she cried out to her companion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Pick up the revolver and shoot him while I hold
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal realized that he was in grave danger and struggled fiercely to
free his hands. But his adversary was a very powerful woman, and having
gained a secure hold, Hal was unable to free himself.</p>

<p>The woman who had been left to guard Chester, at the command of the
other, ran to her aid. Chester, holding to the back of the chair, drew
himself to his feet and staggered after her, still clinging to his
broken sword.</p>

<p>As the woman stooped to pick up the revolver dropped by the other
when Hal&#8217;s bullet had struck her hand, Chester, in spite of the
pain of his wounds, leaped forward. As she arose to her feet and would
have fired point-blank at Hal, he knocked the weapon from her hand with
a sharp blow of his broken sword.</p>

<p>Then coming quickly to Hal&#8217;s side he took the lad&#8217;s
revolver from him, and, stepping back, aimed it at the head of the
woman with whom his friend was struggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Release him instantly,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;or I shall
fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman glanced at him over her shoulder, and smiled
tauntingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t shoot a woman,&#8221; she sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like to,&#8221; replied Chester, &#8220;but
if you have not released him and if both of you do not line up against
that wall with your hands in the air by the time I count three, I will
shoot, just as surely as I stand here. One, two&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman glanced at him. Her eyes must have told her that the lad
meant what he said, for, releasing Hal, she stepped quickly back and
raised her hands in the air. The second woman followed her example.
Chester stepped to Hal&#8217;s side, and extended the revolver to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this quick!&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>Hal did so, and without another word, Chester suddenly crumpled up
in a heap on the floor. He had fainted.</p>

<p>Still covering the women with his revolver, Hal knelt by his
friend&#8217;s side. Then he turned to the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some water!&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>Under the threatening muzzle of the revolver, the woman brought it,
and at a command from Hal, bathed Chester&#8217;s face. Then, still at
Hal&#8217;s command, she lifted the lad and placed him in a chair. Hal
took his seat near the window, for he knew that it was only a question
of time until some of the Russian troops passed in one way or the
other. His revolver still covered the two women, who sat without
uttering a word.</p>

<p>Gradually the color returned to Chester&#8217;s face, and at last he
opened his eyes and looked about. He took in the situation at a glance,
and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I see we won,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; replied Hal grimly. &#8220;How do you
feel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better. I shall be all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you are equal to holding this revolver while I
go out and reconnoiter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; replied Chester. &#8220;Give it to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal put the revolver in his friend&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hesitate to fire if one of them makes a false
move,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They would kill you in a moment if they
had the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use it if necessary; have no fear about
that,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>Hal arose and left the room and the house. He gazed up and down the
road. There was no sign of troops, nor, by listening intently, could he
hear hoof beats. He made his way to where he had left his horse, and
tied it alongside the horse that had brought Chester to the house. Then
he returned to Chester and his prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no telling how long we may have to wait for our men
to return,&#8221; he said to his friend. &#8220;Do you suppose that if
I lifted you up on your horse you could ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the best plan,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;Come, then, we
will try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to Chester&#8217;s side, and still holding the revolver in
his right hand, threw his left arm around his friend&#8217;s neck.
Chester put an arm about Hal&#8217;s shoulder, and thus supported, made
his way from the room without much pain.</p>

<p>Hal made a stirrup of his hand, and Chester, putting his foot into
it, was soon astride his horse, though he winced somewhat with the pain
the exertion gave him. Then Hal sprang into his own saddle, and the two
turned their horses&#8217; heads in the direction of the main body of
Cossacks.</p>

<p>Along the narrow mountain trail they rode slowly for perhaps an hour
without the sight of either friend or foe. Then, rounding a sharp
turning in the pass, at the top of a steep section of the road, Hal
reined in suddenly with a muttered imprecation. Chester followed his
friend&#8217;s example.</p>

<p>Perhaps half a mile away came a body of horsemen, perhaps twenty of
them. The sun, shining upon their uniforms, showed them to be
Austrians. Quickly Hal leaped from his horse, and putting forth his
utmost strength, rolled several great stones into place across the
road, absolutely barring the pass. Then, after Chester had been helped
to the ground, the two lads dropped behind this barrier.</p>

<p>The pass at this point was hardly wide enough for four men to walk
abreast. On each side walls of rock rose straight up for perhaps twenty
feet. Hal looked at his two revolvers and the one he had taken from the
women in the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky we have plenty of ammunition,&#8221; he said
calmly.</p>

<p>He tested all weapons carefully and loaded them. Then he passed one
to Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am keeping two,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;because, being
wounded, you probably won&#8217;t be able to move about as quickly as I
will. I don&#8217;t know how long we shall be able to hold these
fellows off; but if they don&#8217;t rush us, we may be able to hold
out till help arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they were Germans I wouldn&#8217;t feel quite so
easy,&#8221; said Chester; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t believe there is
much likelihood of Austrians rushing us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; said Hal cheerfully.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll probably dismount, hide behind their horses and
try to pick us off.&#8221;</p>

<p>As yet the Austrians were unaware of the presence of enemies in the
pass above them. They came on slowly, laughing and talking. Then one,
chancing to raise his head, saw the barrier in the pass. He called the
attention of the others to it. No sign of an enemy was visible, but the
Austrians approached very carefully.</p>

<p>The two lads waited until the Austrians were so close that a miss
was impossible, then, taking deliberate aim, each fired once. Two of
the enemy fell to the roadside.</p>

<p>There came a cry of dismay from the Austrians, and they reined in
their horses and sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>But two of them had not been quick enough, and while they left their
horses at practically the same time as did the others, they did not
rise again to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four!&#8221; said Chester calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten, if Alexis were doing the counting,&#8221; said Hal
grimly. &#8220;But I would give a whole lot if he were here right
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Austrians forced their horses to lie down, and took up their
positions behind them. Then they blazed away wildly at the barrier
ahead. They could see nothing at which to shoot, however, and their
bullets did no damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the Austrians know this old hat trick?&#8221;
said Chester.</p>

<p>Picking up a little stick, he put his cap upon it and raised it
slowly over the barrier. A hail of bullets flew about it. Chester took
deliberate aim at one of the Austrians who exposed himself, and Hal at
another. Again their revolvers cracked once each, and two Austrians bit
the dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be on even terms soon, if we keep this up,&#8221;
said Hal gleefully.</p>

<p>Chester tried the cap trick again; but this time it did not work.
The Austrians had learned a lesson.</p>

<p>For perhaps five minutes there was silence; then Hal, glancing
quickly over the barrier, saw one of the enemy jump to his feet and
dash straight toward the barrier. In his anxiety to pick the man off,
Hal fired too quickly, and missed.</p>

<p>The man dashed on and flung himself to the ground right up against
the barrier. Here, for the moment, he was safe, for the lads could not
get at him without leaning over the barrier and thus exposing
themselves to the fire of the others.</p>

<p>A second Austrian leaped to his feet and dashed forward. This time,
however, Hal did not hurry, and picked the man off with ease. Hardly
had his weapon spoken, when a shot from below went whizzing by his
head. Hal tumbled back to safety rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to
get that fellow away from there. He almost got me that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but how?&#8221; demanded Chester.</p>

<p>Hal considered the situation for some moments in silence. Then he
passed one of his two revolvers to Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;You blaze away as rapidly as you can at the Austrians with
those two guns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Never mind whether you see
anything to shoot at or not. Just shoot when I give the word.
That&#8217;ll keep those fellows under cover. I&#8217;ll attend to this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over after him!&#8221; said Hal grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is liable to kill you!&#8221; exclaimed Chester in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t get him,&#8221; said Hal quietly, &#8220;he
is sure to kill us both before long. Here goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment that he sprang to the top of the barrier, Chester
opened upon the Austrians with both weapons. The man on the opposite
side of the barrier was taken by surprise by Hal&#8217;s sudden action.
Hal toppled over upon him without warning. With a startled cry the
Austrian raised his weapon to fire, but Hal was too quick for him.</p>

<p>His revolver, less than a foot from the man&#8217;s head, spoke
sharply. Hal waited long enough to see that the work had been well
done, then rose to his feet, placed his hand upon the barrier, and,
amid a hail of bullets from the other Austrians, vaulted back to
safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him!&#8221; he told Chester quietly, as he turned and
emptied his own revolver at the enemy, who seemed on the point of
rushing forward.</p>

<p>Quickly Chester reloaded his own revolvers, and it was well that he
did so, for the enemy seemed to be manifesting a desire to come forward
to the attack, apparently believing that the lads were out of
ammunition.</p>

<p>The lads had now accounted for eight of the enemy, but they were not
so foolish as to believe that the Austrians would remain in their
present position and be picked off one at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll make a rush soon!&#8221; declared Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Hal, &#8220;when they do we&#8217;ll be
ready for &#8217;em. We can shoot straighter than they can while they
are on the run. We should be able to pick off two more each before they
get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a try at it,&#8221; said Chester simply.</p>

<p>It was plainly evident that the Austrians were preparing for a move
of some kind. Suddenly, at a given signal, all twelve of the foe still
alive, sprang to their feet and made a concerted rush toward the
barrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; cried Hal. &#8220;Steady
now!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /><span
class='fss'>IN THE NICK OF TIME.</span></h2>

<p>Hal, at the right of the barrier, confined his attention to that
side of the road, leaving Chester to deal with the enemy rushing
forward on the left. Three times the weapon of each lad spoke, and at
each shot an Austrian fell to the ground. Firing coolly and
deliberately at such close quarters, a miss was absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p>But the lads did not have time to fire again. The enemy was at the
barrier; but, instead of hurling themselves over it, as both lads had
expected they would, they dropped to the ground on the opposite side of
the big rocks, and there they remained.</p>

<p>It was indeed a peculiar situation&#8211;the enemies less than six
feet apart, separated only by a few rocks. Still the Austrians, in
spite of their losses, outnumbered the lads three to one.</p>

<p>Now the rocks of the barrier began to move inward toward the
lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; cried Chester. &#8220;They are trying to
push these rocks over on us. If they tumble this barrier over, we
can&#8217;t hope to account for all six of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads braced themselves against the rocks; but the strength of
the two was not as great as the strength of the six. Such a contest
could have but one ending. The boys realized this as well as did their
foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal calmly, &#8220;it looks as though they
had us. All ready for a last stand, Chester?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; replied Chester calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I say jump,&#8221; instructed Hal, &#8220;leap
backward!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester nodded in understanding of this plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; cried Hal. &#8220;Jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads leaped quickly backward, and as they did so, the
barrier&#8211;freed of their supporting shoulders&#8211;tumbled inward,
while the six Austrians sprawled on the ground. For a moment the lads
had the advantage and they made the best of it.</p>

<p>Hal&#8217;s revolver spoke and one Austrian straightened out in the
act of rising. Chester accounted for another, and then both lads sprang
in close upon the foe, thus precluding the use of the foe&#8217;s
firearms.</p>

<p>Hal, grappling with two of the enemy, was giving a good account of
himself; but Chester, weak from the loss of blood, was unable to hold
his own. A blow from the butt of one of the Austrian&#8217;s revolvers
and he went to the ground.</p>

<p>At that moment, from their rear, came the sound of rapidly galloping
hoofs. Around the bend some distance away dashed a troop of Cossacks,
Alexis himself at their head. The giant Cossack took in the situation
with one comprehensive glance and put spurs to his horse. The two
Austrians who had attacked Chester saw the advancing Cossacks, and,
turning, took to their heels.</p>

<p>The two with whom Hal struggled, however, were too busily occupied
to notice the approach of reënforcements and sorely, each trying to
bring his revolver to bear.</p>

<p>Alexis now jumped from his horse and dashed forward toward the
three. He stretched forth two mighty hands and plucked the Austrians
off the lad. Raising each high in the air, he stretched wide his arms,
and then brought them together with great force. There was a crunch as
the heads of the two met with terrific force. Then they hung limp in
the giant&#8217;s hands. He hurled them from him with a disdainful
gesture, and, snatching his revolver from its holster, dropped to his
knee and fired two shots in quick succession at the two remaining
enemy, who were fleeing down the road.</p>

<p>His aim was true, and as the last of the Austrians bit the dust,
Alexis turned to where Chester lay and picked him up gently in his
arms. From his canteen he poured water over the lad&#8217;s face and
soon came signs of returning consciousness. Then he laid him gently on
the ground and turned to Hal.</p>

<p>He gazed first at the lad, then at the dead bodies of the enemy and
then back to Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm-m-m,&#8221; he said gruffly. &#8220;Quite a fight. But
where would you have been if Alexis had not arrived so
opportunely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead, I guess,&#8221; replied Hal quietly. &#8220;We owe you
our lives, but there is no need to tell you that we are
grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; said Alexis. &#8220;Thanks from one brave
man to another are never necessary; but did you see how easily I
disposed of those four Austrians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very pretty,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; cried the giant gleefully.
&#8220;Still, it was a trifle. I remember the time that
I&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal walked over to Chester&#8217;s side and bent down and so did not
hear the story of Alexis&#8217; might. The giant looked sorrowfully
after him for a moment, muttered to himself and then he walked after
him.</p>

<p>Chester now sat up and looked about. His eyes rested on the dead
bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like Alexis had been here,&#8221; he muttered, for he
had not yet seen the giant.</p>

<p>Alexis heard him and his face glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here,&#8221; he said, stepping forward.</p>

<p>Chester&#8217;s face lighted up.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It is good to see you.
We have wished several times in the last hour that you were with us. We
needed you badly. However, you arrived just in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis blushed like a schoolboy, for he was not used to hearing
others praise his prowess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did arrive in the nick of time,&#8221; he said
awkwardly. &#8220;But come, we must get away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned the strength of the enemy in the
mountains?&#8221; asked Hal a few minutes later, as they rode along
down the pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned enough to make sure that, without infantry and
artillery support, the cavalry will probably be annihilated,&#8221;
replied Alexis briefly. &#8220;By a dash, we might be able to reach the
plains of Hungary, but without support we should end our days there. I
shall counsel retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought you would never counsel retreat?&#8221; said
Hal, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;For myself, never!&#8221; replied the giant. &#8220;But there
are more lives than mine depending upon this. Therefore I say
retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis was as good as his word. Upon their return to the main
column, Alexis was called into consultation with the commanding
officer. He recounted what he had learned, and urged that the retreat
be begun at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are half a million men in these hills,&#8221; he
informed his commander, &#8220;and they are trying to draw us on. We
will be allowed to go so far, and then they will close in on us. One
hundred or two hundred thousand, I don&#8217;t mind. We could whip them
with ease; but half a million are too many for sixty thousand. If we
had not outdistanced our infantry and artillery, we might do it, but
without them, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said the commanding officer, &#8220;I have set
my heart on striking one more blow at the enemy. Would you counsel
against it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always in favor of striking one more blow at the
enemy,&#8221; replied Alexis. &#8220;I suppose I should counsel against
it, but I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed his commander. &#8220;One decisive
blow to the enemy in the hills, and then we shall fall back into
Galicia. Now, where are the Austrians massed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be extremely hazardous,&#8221; said Alexis slowly,
&#8220;but I guess it can be done. Fifteen miles straight along this
mountain pass you come to a small plateau. I advanced that far myself.
Encamped there are in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand of the
enemy. By a quick and silent dash and a night attack, we may be able to
deal them a crushing blow; but even so, we must fall back immediately.
Even then we shall be greatly harassed by the foe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the commander, &#8220;we shall make the
attack, come what may afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis saluted his commander and returned to where he had left the
two lads, where he repeated his interview. Then he turned to
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you will be unable
to take part in the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall take part in it,&#8221; exclaimed the lad.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I am going to sit idle while there is
fighting going on, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you cannot help yourself,&#8221; replied Hal.
&#8220;You will go with the advance, of course; but you will be kept
well in the rear.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain did Chester protest. His commanding officer overruled all of
his complaints, and at last the lad was forced to make his way to the
rear of the Russian army. All that day the army rested, and it was not
until the following afternoon that the signal was given for the
advance, for the Russian commander had so timed his movement that he
would come upon the enemy after nightfall.</p>

<p>It was indeed an imposing sight, these 60,000 men, able to march
scarcely six abreast through the narrow mountain pass, moving hurriedly
through the midst of the wild Carpathians. For miles they stretched
out, but they advanced rapidly, and long before night the advance guard
was within sight of the Austrian position.</p>

<p>This was made known to the Russian commander by his scouts; and
still out of sight, the Cossacks halted.</p>

<p>The pass was considerably wider here, and the men spread out
somewhat. Outposts were thrown out to guard against a counter surprise
attack, and the men allowed to lie down and rest.</p>

<p>The battle formation was preserved, however, and the men fell to
sleep upon their arms, each and every one ready to spring up and dash
forward at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>And still the Austrians were unaware of their approach.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE SURPRISE.</span></h2>

<p>Stealthily the vanguard of the Cossacks crept forward afoot. They
had dismounted that they might approach the enemy with less danger of
being heard. Naked blades were held firmly in their hands; revolvers
and hand grenades were ready. The night attack of the Cossacks was
under way.</p>

<p>Not a shot had been fired. Silently they stole on toward the
sleeping Austrian camp. Feeling perfectly secure in the mountain
fastness and believing their position practically impregnable, the
Austrians failed to keep vigilant watch.</p>

<p>Now the first line of Cossacks, at a whispered word of command, fell
to the ground on their faces. A sentry walked directly toward them, but
in the blackness of the night he did not make out the silent forms.</p>

<p>As he turned his back on them, one shadowy form rose quickly to his
feet and moved swiftly forward. There was the sound of a brief
struggle, a cry stifled in his throat and the Cossacks moved forward
again.</p>

<p>A second and then a third time this operation was repeated. Three
Austrian sentinels lay dead upon the ground; still the camp slept on,
unsuspecting.</p>

<p>More swiftly now, other troops issued from the mountain pass and
spread out in a great semi-circle over the plateau. For two hours this
movement continued in the darkness. The first line of Cossacks stood
ready to fire at the first sign of discovery, but, undiscovered, waited
for the rest of the force to get in position.</p>

<p>A dog in the Austrian camp barked. Others took up the cry. A sentry,
aware of some strange sensation, fired his rifle in the air. At the
moment the last of the Cossacks issued from the mountain pass. These
last troops were mounted and stood with bared lances awaiting the word
to charge.</p>

<p>The huge Austrian camp stirred along its length, but at that instant
the Cossacks sprang to action. Came quick commands from the officers,
and the first line moved upon the Austrian camp at a dead run. A hail
of revolver bullets sped through the canvas of the tents, striking down
those who were yet asleep and reaping a toll of death among those who
were dashing to arms. Then the Cossacks charged with cold steel.</p>

<p>In little parties, without the semblance of formation or discipline,
the Austrians dashed from their tents to beat back this sudden attack.
There was no time for them to fall into position. The Cossacks were
upon them. Right into the heart of the enemy&#8217;s camp rushed the
fearless horde in a terrible charge, cutting, slashing, hewing their
way through.</p>

<p>The Austrians, caught unprepared, gave ground. The Cossacks followed
up their first advantage closely, pressing the enemy so that they had
no time to get into battle formation. A squad of Cossacks sprang toward
a battery of field pieces, quickly wheeled it into position, and opened
fire on the fleeing Austrians. The execution was fearful. Men went down
in heaps, and those that survived fled faster than before.</p>

<p>The surprise was complete. A terrible confusion reigned among the
enemy. The Russians pursued them relentlessly. Here and there men threw
down their arms and surrendered by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Other mountain batteries now had been seized by the Cossacks and
turned upon the foe. For a mile the Cossacks pursued the beaten enemy;
then drew off as suddenly as they had come. Prisoners were abandoned.
Quickly the big guns were put out of commission, and the advance
guard&#8211;now the rearguard&#8211;fell back slowly, protecting the
retreat of those in front.</p>

<p>In almost less time than it takes to tell it, the Cossacks were
again in the saddle and dashing back down the mountain pass.</p>

<p>The Austrians, for a moment, were unable to form in solid ranks.
But, at length, under the command of their officers, they formed and
gave chase. But the Cossacks had too great a start. The losses of the
Austrians had been terrible, those of the Cossacks comparatively
slight. In spite of the fact that they had been in the midst of the
fighting, Hal and Alexis had escaped without injury.</p>

<p>Now the Austrian cavalry, having had time to form, scattered on each
side of the pass and rode after the Cossacks. They came up with the
rear guard, and from the sides poured in bullets, until they were
forced to draw rein because of the treacherous nature of the ground on
either hand. It was here that the Cossacks sustained their heaviest
losses.</p>

<p>But the raid had been a success; there could be no doubt about
that.</p>

<p>The Russian commander was elated as, in the midst of his men, he
ordered the retreat; but as the retreat continued, it became more
hazardous. Even as Alexis had predicted, the mountains swarmed with the
enemy, who rained bullets upon the Russian columns from every hand.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, by noon of the following day the Cossacks
had reached the spot from which they had started the day before; and
here a halt was called. Videttes were placed and the troops settled
down for a brief rest. While they made a good mark for the guerillas,
they nevertheless were in too great force to permit of an attack in
force.</p>

<p>Night fell, and once more the troops sprang to the saddle and
continued their retreat. Morning found the vanguard well out of the
mountains on the plains of Galicia, and soon the last of the rear guard
had issued from the pass. Then the mighty columns spread out. There was
no pursuit, and the commander ordered the retreat conducted more
slowly.</p>

<p>Two days later the columns of raiding Cossacks rode in among the
Russian troop besieging the Galician city of Cracow. Here the commander
decided to remain until he should receive instructions from the Grand
Duke. He dispatched Chester, who had now recovered sufficiently from
his wounds as to be feeling perfectly fit, Hal and Alexis to carry word
of the expedition to the Grand Duke. So the three friends again set out
upon a journey.</p>

<p>They traveled without haste and without incident and at length found
themselves once more in Lodz. Here all three reported to the Russian
commander-in-chief. After receiving his congratulations, and while they
yet stood in his presence, there came a terrible roar from outside the
tent.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke listened intently. Thousands upon thousands of voices
rose on the air. They were cheering. Thousands upon thousands of voices
took up the cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;God save the Czar!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke advanced rapidly toward the entrance to his tent. The
two lads and the giant Cossack made as if to depart; but the Grand
Duke, with a movement of his hand, signified for them to stay and so
they remained.</p>

<p>The sound of cheering drew nearer. The Grand Duke left the tent, and
through the door the lads could see him standing with bared head. Came
the sound of galloping hoofs, and a cavalry troop drew up at the Grand
Duke&#8217;s tent. The latter stepped forward, and giving his hand to a
brilliantly uniformed man, assisted him to dismount. Then, bowing low,
he escorted his visitor into his tent.</p>

<p>As they appeared in the small enclosure Alexis fell upon his knee,
and bowed till his head all but touched the ground.</p>

<p>Nicholas, the Czar of all the Russias, turned toward the three with
a question on his lips. But the Grand Duke spoke first:</p>

<p>&#8220;These, sire, are three of your majesty&#8217;s bravest
soldiers, who have only now returned from a successful raid into the
heart of the Carpathians.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Czar glanced at the two lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;But these,&#8221; he said, pointing his finger at Hal and
Chester, &#8220;are not Russians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sire,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke. &#8220;They are
American lads; but they have rendered invaluable services to our
cause,&#8221; and while the lads stood listening, he gave the Czar a
brief account of some of their experiences.</p>

<p>The Czar advanced and placed a hand upon the shoulder of each.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; he said in perfect English, &#8220;to know
you; and I envy my cousin George the services of such gallant
youths.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads bowed in acknowledgment of this compliment, and the Czar
turned to Alexis, who was still kneeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;surely he is one of my
Cossacks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your majesty,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke.
&#8220;There is not a braver in the whole army,&#8221; and he related
some of Alexis&#8217; feats, as told him days before by Hal and
Chester.</p>

<p>The Czar stretched forth a hand to Alexis, and the latter kissed
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be remembered,&#8221; said the Russian monarch.</p>

<p>Alexis&#8217; face glowed with pleasure. He was so taken by surprise
that he was unable to speak.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke now signified that the three might leave the tent,
and they accordingly bowed themselves out. Outside Alexis could
restrain himself no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I was a brave man!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;but I
am even braver than I thought. I have been addressed by the
Czar!&#8221;</p>

<p>An officer entered the Grand Duke&#8217;s tent, and departed a
moment later in great haste. A second later and the shrill call of a
bugle carried through the town. It was the order for inspection. The
Czar was about to review his troops.</p>

<p>An hour later Czar Nicholas stood before his army, or such a part of
it as could be crowded in the plain before the Grand Duke&#8217;s tent.
Far out it stretched on all sides. In a short address, in which he
praised his troops for their gallantry in action, the Czar predicted
that success would eventually crown the Russian arms. Then he turned to
an officer of the Grand Duke&#8217;s staff and gave a command.</p>

<p>Immediately the latter approached Hal, Chester and Alexis, who,
being apart from their regiments, stood a little to one side watching
the ceremonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>Without a word the three obeyed. Straight to the Czar the officer
led the way, the two lads and the Cossack wondering what it was all
about. In front of the Russian monarch the officer withdrew, leaving
them alone before the Czar.</p>

<p>The Russian ruler stepped between the three, with a smile on his
face drew something from his pocket, approached each in turn and pinned
something on his breast.</p>

<p>Alexis, Hal and Chester let their eyes drop to these objects, and
all three cried out in surprise.</p>

<p>For the Czar of Russia, there in the presence of the army of Poland,
before the Grand Duke and other Russian nobles and dignitaries, with
the eyes of the entire assemblage focused upon them, had pinned upon
the breasts of the two American lads and the giant Cossack the Cross of
the Order of St. George!</p>

<p>It was their reward for bravery, and a great cheer went up from the
assembled hosts.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br /><span
class='fss'>A NEW MISSION.</span></h2>

<p>The two lads were again having an audience of the Grand Duke. The
latter, after ordering them to bear word to the commander of the
Cossack force that had invaded the Carpathians to remain before Cracow
until further notice, had also proposed a new mission to the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to learn,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whether there
is any truth in the report that, in the event we capture Cracow, the
population of Galicia will come to our support and throw off the
Austrian yoke. Of course I have heard these rumors from apparently
reliable sources, but I would prefer to know the truth from someone I
can trust implicitly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be glad to undertake that mission, Your
Excellency,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;I believe that by using a little
strategy we can gain entrance to the city. It would probably be easier
for us than for one of your own men, because we are Americans and may
be able to use that to advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of that,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke.
&#8220;In fact, it is for that reason that I selected you. I will give
you a message to your commander, relieving you from active duty. My
advice is that you do not take Alexis on this mission. He would
probably hinder you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys saluted, and taking the paper the Grand Duke extended to
them, departed. On their way back toward Cracow they informed Alexis of
their mission and of the fact that he was not to accompany them. The
Cossack was disappointed and astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not take me!&#8221; he exclaimed in surprise. &#8220;Why, I
am good for fifty men! You know that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is not a case of strength and fighting,&#8221; Hal
explained. &#8220;This is a case where strategy will count more than a
hundred men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; demanded Alexis, &#8220;am I not a strategist?
Did you not tell me so with your own lips? As a strategist there is
none better than I. Why, I can tell you how I&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Alexis,&#8221; Hal interrupted, &#8220;one look at you
would tell an Austrian your nationality. You cannot expect to fool them
as we did the peasant of the hills. I am sorry, but there is no help
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis was greatly crestfallen, but he admitted the truth of the
boys&#8217; reasoning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true that anyone would know I am a Cossack,&#8221; he
replied, &#8220;but if it came to a fight&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes to a fight,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;we shall
miss you greatly; but we shall have to try and get along without you
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back with their regiment they gave the message releasing them from
active duty to their commander; then, changing their uniforms for
civilian garb and bidding Alexis good-by, they set out in the direction
of the Galician stronghold, making a wide detour so as to approach from
the north, rather than from the direction of the Russian troops in the
East.</p>

<p>They went horseback, and they rode slowly, for they did not wish to
attract undue attention to themselves by too great speed. The route
they traversed made it a good two-days&#8217; journey, and long before
coming to the city proper they encountered bands of Austrian troops. To
these, however, they paid little heed and they were not molested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently they don&#8217;t care who goes in,&#8221; remarked
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks that way,&#8221; replied Hal; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll bet
they pay strict attention to anyone who tries to get out. That&#8217;s
where our hardest work probably will come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you are right,&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they were halted by an Austrian patrol when close to
the city. To him, however, they explained that they were American
tourists, caught in Galicia at the outbreak of the war, and that they
had penetrated beyond the Austrian lines without being aware of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to get back to safety,&#8221; Hal told him.</p>

<p>The Austrian officer smiled and let them pass without further words.
Inside the Galician city the lads prowled about leisurely. The extreme
eastern end of the city was a mass of ruins. The shells hurled by the
big Russian guns had done great damage; but the flames had been
extinguished before they had reached the heart of the city, and as the
Russians had later fallen back a considerable distance the city now was
perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>Night came on, and the lads sought shelter in the home of a Galician
peasant. The house was small but comfortable, and the old man who lived
in it admitted them without question. They repeated to him the story
told the Austrian officer, adding that the place in which they had been
staying had been destroyed by a Russian shell.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your sympathies,&#8221; inquired the old man, &#8220;are
with the Austrians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Hal quietly, &#8220;Russian
barbarism must be wiped out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; replied the old man. &#8220;I suppose you know
there is considerable sentiment in favor of the Russians,
however?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard something to that effect; but I could scarcely
credit it,&#8221; replied Hal guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;it is true. A plot was
discovered not two days ago to give the city into the hands of the
Russians. The conspirators were arrested right here in my house. They
were friends of mine. I was known to be loyal, and my false friends
took advantage of that fact to do their plotting here. Now my house is
watched closely, although they have hesitated to arrest me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man made the two comfortable for the night and left them.
Before preparing for bed the lads talked over what the old man had told
them. As they were getting ready to retire, they heard voices from an
adjoining room.</p>

<p>Through a little hole in the wall they could see a stream of light.
Hal put his eye to the hole. In the room beyond he made out the figures
of two Austrian officers. Then the lad motioned to Chester to remain
silent, and laid his ear to the hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of this other plot?&#8221; came a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly; but we will nip it in the bud. There is no
question but the people would welcome a Russian investment of the city.
Galicia is practically in sympathy with the Russians. We have been hard
put to it to keep them from rising and turning the city over to the
Czar&#8217;s troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am sure we are equal to any occasion,&#8221; said the
first speaker.</p>

<p>Hal turned away from the wall and repeated the conversation to
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all we need to know,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it is,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Now the
question is, how are we to get back to our own lines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan that may work,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;It came
to me a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221; prompted Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hal quietly, &#8220;we will exchange
clothes with those two officers in the next room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better wait until they are asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I believe I have a better plan. Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly the two lads slipped from the room and down the little hall.
Then they turned and made their way back again, coming only as far as
the door to the Austrians&#8217; room. Hal opened it and walked in. At
sight of the two Austrian officers he drew back in well-simulated
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I am in the
wrong room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed one of the
Austrians. &#8220;Are you the Americans who are stopping
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Austrian. &#8220;It&#8217;s early yet;
come in and have a chat with us. You can perhaps tell us some things
about America that we would like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal accepted the invitation, mentally congratulating himself upon
their good fortune. After a lengthy conversation, Hal rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting late,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come,
Chester, we may as well turn in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester also rose. In going to the door it was necessary for Hal to
pass behind one of the Austrians. As he did so, he quickly threw out a
hand and clutched the man by the throat. At the same moment Chester
sprang upon the second unsuspecting officer, and the cry that the
latter would have let out was stifled in his throat by the pressure of
the lad&#8217;s fingers.</p>

<p>Hal now produced a revolver, and Chester did likewise. They covered
the two officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;One outcry and you are dead men,&#8221; said Hal calmly.</p>

<p>While Chester kept them covered, Hal bound and gagged them. Then the
two lads stripped them of their uniforms, which they donned themselves.
Feeling perfectly secure in these, the lads saw that the prisoners were
well tied and unable to cry out, and then left the room, shutting the
door behind them.</p>

<p>In the hall they encountered their host, but the latter, recognizing
the Austrian uniform, did not even speak to them. The lads left the
house quietly, and turned their faces toward the north, intending to go
back by the way they had come.</p>

<p>Several times they were spoken to by Austrian officers as they
walked along the streets, but to these salutations they made no reply,
trusting that their apparent rudeness would cast no suspicion upon
them. And it did not.</p>

<p>At length they came to the farthest Austrian outpost, and here, for
the first time they were challenged. Hal stepped a little ahead of
Chester and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are inspecting the lines,&#8221; he said calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot pass here,&#8221; came the reply. &#8220;My orders
are to shoot anyone who attempts to get by. The general himself
couldn&#8217;t pass. You will have to go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, if that&#8217;s the way you feel about
it,&#8221; said Hal, turning his back upon the sentry.</p>

<p>The sentry, believing that the lads would go away, lowered his
rifle, and in that moment Hal turned quickly again and sprang upon him.
A quick blow knocked the sentry from his feet, and the lads dashed
forward. In the distance Hal made out the form of several horses, and
the lads ran toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Chester!&#8221; cried Hal.</p>

<p>But the Austrian sentry had not been knocked unconscious. He was
only stunned. He staggered to his feet, brought his rifle to his
shoulder and fired. He was too unsteady to aim carefully, however, and
the lads were unhurt.</p>

<p>But the sound of the shot aroused the Austrian camp. Men came
rushing forward.</p>

<p>The boys leaped to the backs of two horses and spurred on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a race for life, Hal!&#8221; shouted Chester, as
the horses dashed ahead.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /><span
class='fss'>A DASH FOR LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>One glance over his shoulder convinced Hal that at least half a
dozen of the enemy had mounted and were spurring forward in pursuit. He
passed the word to Chester, and bending low in their saddles, the lads
urged their horses to greater efforts.</p>

<p>From ahead suddenly came a body of horsemen. Before they realized
it, the lads were dashing by these at a distance of less than a hundred
yards. Here the Austrian uniforms stood them in good stead. The officer
hesitated to give a command to his men to fire on what were apparently
Austrian officers, and before he was made aware of the situation by
shouts from behind, the lads had placed considerable distance between
themselves and these new enemies.</p>

<p>Now the latter also turned and gave chase.</p>

<p>After some minutes the lads realized that they were easily
maintaining their lead and breathed easier.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get away yet if our horses don&#8217;t give
out!&#8221; shouted Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; Hal shouted back. &#8220;Keep up the
pace!&#8221;</p>

<p>In their haste in seizing upon two horses, the lads had not had time
to look the animals over and it soon developed that they had made a bad
choice. The animals which the boys bestrode had returned only an hour
before from a long and tedious journey, and consequently were almost
exhausted. Under the spur they put forth their best efforts, but
finally they began to tire, and despite the urging of the lads,
faltered in their stride.</p>

<p>Hal was the first to notice this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it is all up!&#8221; he shouted to Chester.</p>

<p>Right in the face of his oncoming enemies he drew rein. Chester
followed his example, and then both lads quickly dismounted.</p>

<p>At this spot there was a small clump of trees. Slapping their horses
across the flanks with their hats, the lads plunged in among the
foliage while the tired horses made off slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up into these trees quick,&#8221; shouted Chester. &#8220;It
has saved us before; it may again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly the lads clambered up among the branches, where they lay
perfectly still. The sound of the approaching Austrians grew nearer,
and at last half a dozen of the enemy pulled up their mounts almost
under the lads&#8217; hiding place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221; asked a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have probably made off through the woods,&#8221; said a
second. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to search for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tree in which the lads were hiding was the largest nearby. Up in
its dense foliage the boys were absolutely hidden from the ground
below. One of the Austrians glanced up into the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be hiding up here,&#8221; he said to his
companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly likely,&#8221; replied a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll send up a couple of shots and see,&#8221;
said the first speaker.</p>

<p>His rifle spoke sharply twice. Hal felt a slight stinging sensation
in his left arm. One of the bullets, as it passed, brushed his skin.
The other sang close to Chester&#8217;s head. But in spite of this, and
in spite of the fact that another shot from below might end one of
their lives, neither boy so much as shifted his position.</p>

<p>After firing the shot into the tree the Austrian became still,
listening, as did his companions. There was no sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t be up there,&#8221; said a voice. &#8220;If
they were, and even had not been hit, they couldn&#8217;t remain
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said another voice. &#8220;We shall
have to look for them elsewhere. Scatter out, men, and we&#8217;ll
search the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Austrians moved from beneath the tree. Waiting until he was sure
that they had gone, Chester whispered to Hal:</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If possible,&#8221; replied Hal, &#8220;we shall slip down
and try to pick out a couple of fresh horses. Then we can make another
dash for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Chester, &#8220;but we had better
wait here until we can get down the tree unseen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal nodded in assent, and for perhaps half an hour the lads waited
silently. In the distance they could hear the enemy beating up the
bushes for some trace of them, but these sounds gradually grew farther
away; then died down altogether.</p>

<p>Cautiously Hal peered down from his hiding place. There was no sign
of an enemy. The lad dropped quickly to the ground, and Chester
followed suit a moment later. Then they dashed silently toward the
road.</p>

<p>Upon entering the woods in pursuit of the fugitives, the Austrians
had abandoned their horses and were searching afoot. Approaching the
edge of the forest, the lads saw six horses tied to trees. They ran
rapidly toward them. As they did so a single Austrian, who had been
left to guard the animals, stepped suddenly forward, raised his rifle
and cried: &#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no time for either lad to draw his revolver.
Chester&#8217;s hand went to his pocket, even as he ran, but he did not
wait to extract the weapon. With his hand still in his pocket, he
pointed the muzzle of his revolver at the Austrian and pressed the
trigger. The bullet sped true through the cloth, and the Austrian
dropped his rifle and toppled over to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work, Chester!&#8221; shouted Hal, not pausing in his
stride toward the horses.</p>

<p>He had all six horses untied in a jiffy, and passing the bridle of
one to his chum, leaped lightly into the saddle. Chester did likewise.
The other horses stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use leaving them here for the enemy to pursue us
with,&#8221; decided Chester.</p>

<p>He rode his own horse among the others, and with several quick blows
of his cap, started them on ahead of them.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Austrians who had been scouring the woods for
the fugitives, attracted by the sound of the shot, came into sight and
dashed toward the lads, their revolvers spitting fire as they ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Hal to Chester.</p>

<p>It was no time to hesitate, nor to fight back while there was a
chance of getting away. Putting spurs to their horses both lads were
soon out of range.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;we shall have to keep a
sharp lookout for other Austrians in front; for it is certain all of
our pursuers didn&#8217;t enter the woods after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>They rode forward at a quick trot, and soon were out of sight of the
enemy behind. For perhaps fifteen minutes they continued on their way
without interruption, and then a band of horsemen bore down on
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Austrians,&#8221; said Chester briefly. &#8220;What shall we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go straight ahead,&#8221; replied Hal quickly. &#8220;Perhaps
they will not recognize us. We still have our Austrian uniforms. It may
be they will take us for some of the searching party.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drew nearer the approaching horsemen. The latter reined in
their mounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find them?&#8221; Hal called out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came back the reply; &#8220;did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;they must have given us the
slip.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horsemen came closer and Hal and Chester kept their faces
averted as much as possible, for they knew that a close scrutiny would
betray their identity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; shouted Hal, &#8220;we will look a little
farther on. You search the woods. Perhaps your eyes may be better than
ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was the reply, and the boys rode on slowly
so as to give their mounts a rest. Some moments later there was a great
commotion behind, and turning in their saddles, the lads saw the
Austrians coming rapidly after them. They had come upon the little
party who had seen the lads leaving the woods.</p>

<p>With a cry to Chester, Hal put spurs to his horse and soon both were
literally flying over the ground, the Austrians in full chase.</p>

<p>But the horses that the boys now bestrode were much fresher than had
been their first mounts; still, Hal saw that several of the Austrians
were gaining.</p>

<p>Now one of the enemy drew well ahead of his companions, a bit behind
came a second, while a third, who was some distance ahead of the
remainder, closely followed the second. These three, at their
respective distances, slowly drew closer to the lads.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a word to Hal, Chester checked his horse abruptly,
and his revolver flashed in his hand. Before the first Austrian could
check his mount, he had come within range of the lad&#8217;s weapon,
which spoke sharply. The Austrian tumbled sidewise from his horse.</p>

<p>Chester turned and spurred on after Hal.</p>

<p>Now the second Austrian drew close upon the lad. Once more the
latter abruptly checked his horse and turned to face the Austrian. The
latter, perceiving the boy&#8217;s maneuver, also drew rein. But he was
not quick enough, and a second bullet from Chester&#8217;s revolver
laid him low. Once more the lad turned his horse&#8217;s head forward
and dashed on.</p>

<p>The third Austrian, unmindful of the fate that had overtaken his two
companions, still dashed after the lads. He gained steadily, and was
now a considerable distance ahead of the main body of the enemy. A
third time Chester turned suddenly on the foe and a third time his
revolver spoke. He missed, and the Austrian opened with his own
revolver. But his aim was no better.</p>

<p>Chester, sitting quietly on his horse, then took careful and
deliberate aim and at his next shot, the Austrian fell to the ground.
Then he turned and rode on after Hal, who had slowed down to wait for
him.</p>

<p>Once more the lads put spurs to their horses and dashed
on&#8211;each forward stride of their animals taking them much nearer
the Russian lines and safety&#8211;until at last they made out in the
distance the outposts of the Russian camp.</p>

<p>Hal raised a cry of triumph, but at the same moment his horse
stepped into a hole and went to his knees, hurling Hal over his
head.</p>

<p>Chester reined in alongside his friend and leaped to the ground. The
Austrians, perceiving the lad&#8217;s misfortune, bore down on them
with a wild cry of joy.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /><span
class='fss'>SAFE.</span></h2>

<p>In spite of his tumble, Hal was uninjured and sprang quickly to his
feet. Chester turned to the prostrate horse, and attempted to get it to
its feet. The horse moaned with pain, and Chester gave up the attempt,
for he realized in an instant that the animal had broken its leg in the
fall.</p>

<p>With revolvers in hands, both lads turned to face their foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t give up without a fight!&#8221; declared Hal
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t give up without a fight!&#8221; Chester
agreed.</p>

<p>Standing behind the horse that was still on its feet the two lads
pointed their weapons at the foe, who bore down upon them at top speed.
There were at least a score of them, and the boys realized that the
encounter could have but one end. Still they were determined to fight
it out.</p>

<p>But now, from the rear, came a fierce yell. Turning their eyes
momentarily in that direction, the lads beheld a welcome sight. Mounted
on their superb chargers and galloping forward as swiftly as the wind,
came a full squadron of Russian Cossacks; and as they came on, with
loose-hanging reins, waving their weapons in the air, the fierce
Cossack yell split the air time after time.</p>

<p>The Austrians hesitated; then, not mindful to retreat and allow
their victims, whom they had followed so far, to escape scot-free they
advanced on the lads again. Chester calmly picked off the first man on
the right, and Hal disposed of the first man on the left. Realizing
that assistance was on the way, the boys fought coolly and with
determination, keeping the rearing and plunging horse always between
them and their foes.</p>

<p>But this protection was soon removed. An Austrian bullet struck the
horse in the head and he fell to the ground. Quickly the lads dropped
behind the prostrate body and continued to pop away at their enemies.
Two more went down, and still the lads were uninjured. The Cossacks
were still some distance away, although approaching with the swiftness
of the wind. The Austrians, seeking to end the encounter, spread out,
fan-wise, and drew in upon the lads from three sides. The lads shifted
their positions so as still to face all their foes. Then the Austrians
came forward on a charge.</p>

<p>But they had delayed too long, for now the onrushing Cossacks had
come within range, and a powerful voice rang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Faster!&#8221;</p>

<p>In response to this command, the gallant chargers of the Cossacks
leaped forward. A volley rang out, and bullets whistling over the heads
of Hal and Chester found lodgment in Austrian breasts and heads. The
enemy turned and fled.</p>

<p>With a quick word of command to his men the Cossack captain, now
close to the kneeling lads, pulled in his horse with a sudden movement
and sprang to the ground. The rest of the troop continued its mad dash
after the Austrians, who were fleeing as fast as their tired horses
could carry them.</p>

<p>There was but one possible result of such a chase. Noble animals,
though the Austrian horses were, they were no match, at their best, for
the Cossack chargers. And there was no mercy in the hearts of the
Cossacks for their enemies. The Austrians did not cry for quarter, and
no quarter was given. Ten minutes later the Cossacks, their ranks
thinned by four, returned to where their leader had dismounted beside
the lads.</p>

<p>As the Cossack commander flung himself to the ground by their side,
both lads gave a cry of glad surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis!&#8221; they exclaimed in a single voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same!&#8221; replied their Cossack friend.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me any more about your strategy. Where would
you have been, if I hadn&#8217;t arrived just now, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Chester slowly, &#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t be
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have been dead, that&#8217;s where you would have
been,&#8221; said Alexis calmly. &#8220;As it was, I almost arrived too
late. Perhaps next time you will not leave me behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t try to thank you,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;But
how did you happen to arrive so opportunely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Alexis, &#8220;looking across the plain I
saw two horsemen pursued by many others. I knew you would return from
that direction, and I surmised who it was. But here is one case where
my keen eyesight almost worked to your disadvantage. I made out your
Austrian uniforms, even as I would have ordered my men forward, and
hesitated. It wasn&#8217;t any of my business if two Austrians were
killed. Then I remembered your talk of strategy, and guessed that maybe
the uniforms were part of it. But, you may take my word for it, you
almost used too much strategy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis now ordered one of his men to secure two of the riderless
horses, and, mounting, the lads rode back toward the Russian lines with
the Cossack troop. Here they wasted no time, but started at once on
their return journey to Lodz, Alexis, having obtained permission from
his superior officer, going with them.</p>

<p>Grand Duke Nicholas was well pleased with the lads&#8217; report and
complimented them highly upon their bravery and resourcefulness. Then
he added, somewhat sorrowfully, the lads thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall indeed be sorry to lose you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To lose us!&#8221; exclaimed Chester, in surprise.
&#8220;Why, Your Excellency, we have no intention of being
killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke, with
a slight smile, &#8220;but I have other work of importance for you. In
fact, I may say of greater importance than any which you have yet
accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we shall be glad to undertake it, no matter what it
is,&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;I am sure we can carry it through
successfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke dryly. &#8220;After
some of the things you have done, I would not say there is anything you
cannot do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this new mission?&#8221; questioned Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new mission,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke, &#8220;will
carry you back into France.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed both lads in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said the Grand Duke. &#8220;That is why I
said I would be sorry to lose you, for I know that, once back with the
British troops, you will not return again to Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Your Excellency,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;we have
seen service with the Cossacks, and we like it immensely,
but&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; interrupted the Grand Duke, &#8220;you would much
prefer to be fighting with the English, your own people, or a kindred
people, at least. Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads bowed in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, Your Excellency,&#8221; replied Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Grand Duke, &#8220;so be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a document, which he placed in Hal&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will place in the hands of
either Sir John French, the British commander, or General Joffre, the
French commander-in-chief. I could, of course, send the message by
wireless to London, but it would be intercepted by the Germans, and,
while it naturally would be sent in code, I am not at all sure that the
Germans could not decipher it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall we start, Your Excellency?&#8221; asked
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever it is convenient,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;And
the manner of your going I leave entirely to you. I will not hamper you
with instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; said Hal, struck with a sudden
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to make a request.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider it granted,&#8221; said the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;I should like to ask
permission to take Alexis with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke was plainly surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be of great aid to us in getting through,&#8221; Hal
explained. &#8220;His strength is prodigious, and more than once, as I
have told you, has stood us in good stead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Grand Duke thoughtfully, &#8220;I will
not order him to accompany you, for he would be out of his element on
the other side; but, if he is willing to go, he has my
permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some further talk the boys took a friendly farewell of the
commander-in-chief of the Russian armies and left the tent. They hunted
up Alexis immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alexis,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;to-morrow we start back
for France!&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant Cossack was on his feet in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you are going away for good?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Chester.</p>

<p>Alexis, although not an emotional man, was stirred deeply. The boys
realized it in an instant; but he was not the man to give way to his
feelings, and he said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry. I wish that you would remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hal broached his plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how would you like to come
with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go with you?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;To
France?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what would I do in France?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight!&#8221; replied Chester briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; muttered Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Grand Duke has given his permission, if you desire to
go,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;and we would indeed be glad to have you. We
have grown very fond of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I of you,&#8221; replied Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;In France,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;there are no such men
as you. You would be a veritable Hercules, a man among men. Brave men
there are there in plenty, but none such as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His vanity thus appealed to, Alexis saw the matter in a different
light. He slapped one great fist down upon the table in a mighty
blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /><span
class='fss'>ON NEUTRAL SOIL.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Surely you are not afraid, Alexis?&#8221; exclaimed
Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221; shouted Alexis. &#8220;Of course I am not
afraid. But&#8221;&#8211;he eyed the large aëroplane
dubiously&#8211;&#8220;but a man was not made to fly about in the air
like a bird, particularly a man of my weight. Besides, I do not like
great height. If I stand upon a precipice, I am immediately struck with
the notion that I must jump off. If I jumped from an aëroplane I might
upset it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Hal and Chester laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was that way myself once,&#8221; said Chester, &#8220;so I
know just how you feel. Many a man, otherwise very brave, has that same
horror of height. However, you will soon get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; said Alexis dubiously. &#8220;However, if
one man can fly, why, so can I. I am willing to take a
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Hal. &#8220;Now to get
started.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving Lodz, the three had made their way north, keeping as close
to the German border as was safe, until they had reached Riga, on the
Gulf of Riga, which extends in from the Baltic Sea. Here they had at
first thought of going part of the distance by boat, but, because of
the likelihood of the approach of German warships in the Baltic, had
given up this plan and decided upon an aëroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came to Russia in an airship,&#8221; Hal had said.
&#8220;We might as well go back in one. Besides, it is
quicker.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>Ten miles south of Riga, surrounded by Russian airmen, they climbed
into the craft which the Russian commander in the little city had
provided for them. The plane was large and roomy, having a seating
capacity of five.</p>

<p>Hal took his place at the steering wheel and Chester climbed
aboard.</p>

<p>Still eyeing the flying craft suspiciously, Alexis followed Chester,
and, sitting down suddenly, took hold of the seat with both hands and
hung on for dear life, although the craft was still upon the ground.
Then he lowered his head and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Hal gave the word, and willing hands started the machine along the
ground. Gradually it gained momentum until it was skimming over the
ground at a rapid gait. Then Hal threw over the elevating lever, and
the machine shot into the air amid the cheers of the Russians
below.</p>

<p>Alexis was conscious of a sinking sensation in the region of his
stomach, and he ducked his head even lower as the car rose higher in
the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look up, Alexis!&#8221; shouted Chester, reaching over and
laying a hand on the Cossack&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Now that the machine had reached a good height, Hal held it steady,
and it darted ahead on a straightaway course. The plane shook with the
vibrations of the engine, but otherwise there was scarcely a noticeable
motion.</p>

<p>Now that the machine was more steady, Alexis, in response to
Chester&#8217;s command, slowly opened his eyes and looked about.
Seeing nothing, he closed them again immediately, and again ducked his
head. Once more Chester yelled at him to look about, and at last Alexis
raised his head and glanced into the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a terrible place for a man to be,&#8221; he muttered
with a shudder. &#8220;If man were meant to fly he would have been
given wings. It is tempting the wrath of the elements to be
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he looked about him, however, and became conscious of the
steadiness of the craft, his composure returned, and soon he was making
inquiries regarding the construction of the craft, its speed and the
height to which it could ascend. He glanced over the side of the
machine, and then looked quickly upward again. The one glance below had
made him ill.</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t look down yet,&#8221; he
said ruefully. &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll get used to it in time; but
now I had better keep my eyes inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fast are we going, Hal?&#8221; asked Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty-five miles an hour,&#8221; was Hal&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>Alexis was astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty-five miles!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;Why, it seems
as if we were standing still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were close enough to the earth you would soon notice
the difference,&#8221; said Chester.</p>

<p>For another hour they continued on their way without incident, and
then Chester discovered the dim outline of a second aircraft trailing
them at a distance. It was not gaining, but even when Hal put on more
speed, at a word from Chester, he was unable to shake it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently a German,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;I suppose he
wants to see where we are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>For another hour the plane pursued them. Then Chester perceived that
there were two instead of one, and that both were creeping up on
them.</p>

<p>With a cry to Hal, Chester picked two rifles from the bottom of the
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to fight them off!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Alexis stirred uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid of it,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Now, what will
happen to me when I go hurtling through space to the ground
below?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shuddered.</p>

<p>Hal, in response to a command from Chester, slowed down suddenly.
Taking careful aim at one of the pursuers, Chester emptied the magazine
of his first rifle. There came from behind the sounds of screams,
followed by an explosion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; cried Alexis in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got one of them!&#8221; replied Chester calmly. &#8220;The
plane has gone to earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second pursuing plane reduced its speed, but still clung on the
trail of its would-be prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to dispose of it some way, Hal,&#8221;
shouted Chester. &#8220;Turn quickly and run toward it, and I&#8217;ll
see if I can&#8217;t send it to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his rifle ready as he spoke. Reducing the speed of the craft
a trifle, Hal brought its head about in a wide circle; then darted
suddenly toward the enemy.</p>

<p>But the latter was not caught unprepared, and a rifle bullet
whistled close to Alexis&#8217; ear.</p>

<p>The giant Cossack clapped a hand to his head and for the first time
looked toward the enemy. Then, reaching to the bottom of the machine,
he raised up with a weapon, and, aiming at the hull of the enemy in the
distance, poured the entire contents of the magazine into it. At the
same moment a well-directed shot from Chester&#8217;s rifle struck the
pilot. He sprang to his feet, spun around crazily, and plunged from the
car. A moment later and the aëroplane blew up with a loud bang.</p>

<p>Alexis, who had seen the pilot go overboard, let out a cry of
dismay. He could not help but think of the terrible fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work, Alexis!&#8221; cried Chester. &#8220;I told you
you would get used to it before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not used to it,&#8221; replied the giant, &#8220;but
when a bullet whistles past my ear I get mad. I just naturally have to
fight back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless he made a brave effort to appear unconcerned, and he
took a look over the side. At that moment Hal allowed the car to glide
slowly nearer the earth. For a moment Alexis was unaware of this
sinking sensation; but suddenly treetops came into view, and the
Cossack let out a cry of alarm:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sinking!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Hal laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just coming down to get a look about,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Now, if you will look over at the earth a few moments, you will
soon overcome your uneasiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexis, taking a long breath, did so; and he continued to peer over
the side, even after Hal, touching the elevating lever, sent the plane
high in the air again.</p>

<p>Darkness fell and still the &#8217;plane sped on. Then, so suddenly
that they seemed to spring up from nowhere, the swiftly moving
aëroplane was surrounded on all sides&#8211;as it seemed to the
voyagers&#8211;by a score of hostile aircraft, while shots rang out
from several sides.</p>

<p>Hal acted promptly, as had always been his wont. He allowed the
&#8217;plane to drop a good quarter of a mile with a sudden lurch, and
then righting it, darted forward again. For a moment they had shaken
off the foe, but the latter was not long in finding them. Searchlights
flashed in the sky, seeking out the prey.</p>

<p>By a series of clever maneuvers, Hal succeeded in evading the
hostile craft during the long hours of the night, turning first this
way and then that, rising and falling. But with the first gray of dawn,
it became plain to both boys that escape was practically impossible.
Looking down Hal saw water below him, and at the same moment the
hostile air fleet ten &#8217;planes strong, swooped down on them.</p>

<p>Chester&#8217;s rifle cracked, as did that of Alexis. Bullets flew
about all three occupants of the machine, and then the craft, struck in
a vital spot, staggered. The &#8217;plane began to sink slowly. In vain
did Hal try to check the descent. The machine, still heading slightly
toward the north, glided toward the water below.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hal made out something below besides water. It was land.
The lad breathed easier, for it was plain, that at the rate at which
the craft was sinking, it could clear the water by a good quarter of a
mile, beyond which the lad could see a sandy coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be the coast of Sweden or Denmark,&#8221; he said to
himself, &#8220;in which event we are safe, for it is neutral
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Germans, realizing that their foe was sinking, did not waste
another shot on it, but swarmed after. Now the craft was close to the
water. Gently it skimmed over it, across a short stretch of sand, and
then settled slowly to the ground.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester glanced about. There was no one in sight on the
sandy beach and the Germans were coming right after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though this be Sweden,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;unless
Swedish troops come to our aid, the Germans are likely to violate the
neutrality of the country and take us anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not without a fight,&#8221; declared Alexis. &#8220;Let me
get my feet on the ground again, and I will show you such a fight as
you never saw. On the ground I can fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the &#8217;plane was but a few scant yards from the earth. It
grounded with a shock.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /><span
class='fss'>THE DEATH OF A TITAN.</span></h2>

<p>Quickly the three leaped out. In spite of the Germans hovering
overhead, Hal examined the &#8217;plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he exclaimed, after a quick, though
careful, inspection. &#8220;I can fix this thing in five
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the German machines came to the ground a short distance away.
From each craft leaped three men, who dashed toward the three
friends.</p>

<p>Alexis turned to Hal and Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you,&#8221; he said calmly, &#8220;fix up the airship. I
will meet these fellows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before either lad could reply, he had hurled himself upon the
foe.</p>

<p>For some reason, probably because they did not wish to attract the
attention of the Swedish authorities by the sounds of a struggle, the
Germans, at first, drew no firearms. Perceiving but one form rushing
toward them, they advanced to meet him confidently. Plainly they
considered it the wild dash of a madman.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester turned their attention to the aëroplane, and while
Alexis fought against overwhelming numbers, they overhauled it
carefully.</p>

<p>Right into the midst of his foes rushed the giant. Such a superb
attack was never seen before&#8211;such a mad wild dash as he took the
enemy by surprise and hurled them back&#8211;all of them&#8211;back
against the airships that stood on the sands.</p>

<p>As the huge Cossack rushed forward, his sword flashed above his
head. His revolver he gripped tightly by the barrel. A fighting fire
darted from his eye, and his thin lips were bared in a slight
smile.</p>

<p>If ever a man felt the joy of battle it was he. He heeded not the
number of his adversaries nor the steel that flashed forth against him.
Slashing, cutting, parrying, thrusting, he hurled himself in upon them.
They were carried back by the very fierceness of his attack. They gave
way before him, parting to retreat around one of the aircraft. With one
swift sweep of his foot, Alexis tore a ragged hole in the bottom of the
first craft; and at the same instant two men fell beneath his slashing
blows.</p>

<p>They could not stand before him&#8211;their very numbers were
against them as the giant pressed ever forward. Now a man dropped to
the ground and seized the giant by the left leg, thinking to drag him
down. Alexis drove his right boot into the man&#8217;s face, and at the
same moment, by a quick back-handed sweep of his sword, cut down a man
who would have sprung upon his back.</p>

<p>His revolver rose and fell, once, twice, three times, and beneath
these crushing blows more Germans went down. But Alexis did not escape
unscathed. A sword thrust had pierced his chest, not deeply, but the
blood streamed forth. There was a gaping wound in his cheek; his
clothing was pierced in a dozen places.</p>

<p>But in spite of this he pressed on. He thought only of advance,
never of retreat; and as he hurled his gigantic body, time after time,
upon the overwhelming number of his foes, they gave back in
consternation and astonishment.</p>

<p>Ten men lay dead upon the ground, their skulls battered by fierce
blows of the revolver, or pierced through and through by the great
sword.</p>

<p>And now Hal and Chester, the aëroplane once more ready for flight,
dashed forward to the rescue with loud cries.</p>

<p>They ranged themselves alongside the fighting Cossack. He greeted
them with a half-smile; he had no time for more. Three men threw
themselves upon him. One he hurled from him with a stroke of his mighty
leg, another felt the weight of his revolver butt and the third fell
back with a sword wound in his chest.</p>

<p>Unmindful of his own danger, the giant turned to the aid of Chester,
who, at that moment was at the mercy of an enemy&#8217;s sword. A
mighty stroke of the massive arm and the German lay dead on the
ground.</p>

<p>The Germans, having had the worst of this encounter with a single
foe, stood back and drew their revolvers. Quickly Alexis reversed his
own weapon and fired. There was one enemy less. A bullet struck him in
the chest. He staggered, but recovered, and again fired at his
foes.</p>

<p>The revolvers of the two lads were also spitting fire. A bullet
grazed Hal&#8217;s head and he toppled over. He was up in a moment,
however, fighting more fiercely than before. Chester felt a stinging
sensation in his right arm. Quickly he transferred his weapon to his
left hand, and it continued to send out its deadly missiles.</p>

<p>But this unequal contest could not last. It must be ended.</p>

<p>Alexis, wounded in a score of places, his giant body hacked and
hewn, hurled himself forward in one last desperate attack. Germans
quailed before the very fury of his face; they tumbled here and there
beneath his sword, or sweeping blows of his now empty revolver. A
bullet struck the giant in the throat. He dropped his revolver and
clapped his hand to the wound. Another struck him in the shoulder. He
sprang forward, struck down another of the enemy, then staggered
back.</p>

<p>And at that moment there came the sound of tramping footsteps on the
sand. Turning quickly Hal and Chester perceived approaching rapidly a
body of Swedish troops. The Germans saw them at the same instant. They
were still a mile away across the sands, but the Germans had no mind to
be caught and interned. Quickly they leaped for their aircraft, all
except those who remained upon the sands, their faces turned upward or
buried therein.</p>

<p>Hal and Chester each seized Alexis by an arm and dragged him back
toward their own aëroplane, now righted and waiting only the touch that
would send it into the air. The giant Cossack staggered along, but it
was plain to both lads that he was about to collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, Alexis!&#8221; cried Hal, trying to urge him on.
&#8220;Only a few more steps and we will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the very side of the craft they carried him; but here, shaking
himself free of their detaining hands, he suddenly fell, face forward,
upon the ground. Quickly the two lads bent over him, and succeeded in
turning him on his back.</p>

<p>His voice came in faint gasps. The boys bent near to catch what he
was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me here! You go on!&#8221; came his voice. &#8220;I am
done for! Save yourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads waited to hear no more. Chester took him by the feet and
Hal by the head, and with great effort succeeded in placing him within
the aëroplane, stretching him out, as well as they could across two of
the seats. Then Chester sprang in and Hal jumped to the wheel.</p>

<p>Along the beach the craft skimmed lightly, then arose from the
ground. At the same instant a volley rang out from the approaching
Swedish troops and the officer in command called out to surrender. The
German airships, for some unaccountable reason, had not waited to
resume the fight upon ascending into the air, but had made off.</p>

<p>Hal headed the aëroplane due westward, making for the coast of
England. Alexis had lapsed into unconsciousness upon being placed in
the machine, but now he stirred feebly and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;A real fight, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;I
told you I could do it if I were on the ground. How many was it I
killed? Twenty&#8211;thirty&#8211;forty&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off and burst into a fit of coughing. Chester bent over him
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right in a day or two, old man,&#8221; he
said gently.</p>

<p>Alexis smiled feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to fool me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am a
man. I know when death is near and I am not afraid to face
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads realized that their giant Cossack friend was near his end,
but there was nothing they could do for him. Chester bound up the
wounds as well as he could, stopping the flow of blood, but that was
all.</p>

<p>As the aëroplane flew over the sea toward the coast of England, the
dying man continued to talk. Now he sat up in the craft and gazed down
over the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had always thought,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that I
should end my days in my own land. As it is I shall not end them in any
land at all; but in the air. It is strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal slowed the aëroplane down until it was barely moving and turned
to Alexis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are not going to
die. In a few hours we shall be in England, where you shall have the
best of medical attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late,&#8221; replied the Cossack calmly. &#8220;I
shall not live an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>His breath came with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing I should like to know,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Alexis?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what you meant by &#8216;drawing the long
bow&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal was silent for some moments, and then replied gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man boasts of things he has never done, in America it
is called &#8216;drawing the long bow.&#8217; I was mistaken in your
case. It would be impossible for you to &#8216;draw the long
bow.&#8217; You have done too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; agreed Chester.</p>

<p>Suddenly the giant frame fell back. Hal turned as best he could
while Chester leaned over him anxiously. Alexis extended a hand to each
of them, which they grasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, pressing their hands in a still strong
grip, &#8220;is the end. I wish that I could have lived to see the
outcome of this war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be but one outcome,&#8221; replied Chester softly.
&#8220;You may rest assured of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;but I would like to have
seen my old home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were silent. Finally Hal spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we are responsible for
your fate; but for us you would have remained with the army and have
lived to the end of the war. We are to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h,&#8221; whispered the dying giant. The hand which held
Chester&#8217;s freed itself and groped in his pocket. &#8220;But for
you lads,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I should never have won
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled from his pocket the Cross of St. George, pinned to his
breast by the Russian emperor, and gazed at it lovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well worth the sacrifice,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Still holding the medal his hand again sought Chester&#8217;s and
pressed it. His other hand still gripped Hal&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, boys,&#8221; he said firmly. &#8220;Let the Grand
Duke know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pressure upon their hands relaxed. The giant frame of Alexis
Vergoff, brave man and fighter extraordinary, stiffened and lay still.
He was dead.</p>

<p>And as the aëroplane swept over the sea to the distant coast of
England Hal and Chester mourned the loss of a true and stanch
friend.</p>

<p>Arrived in England the lads saw the body of Alexis laid to rest with
fitting honors, and continued their mission to the continent, where Hal
put the document entrusted to his care by the Russian Grand Duke
Nicholas into the hands of Field Marshal Sir John French,
commander-in-chief of the British forces on the continent.</p>

<p>And so we shall take leave of them for a short time. Their
subsequent adventures will be found in a succeeding volume, entitled:
&#8220;The Boy Allies in the Trenches; or Midst Shot and Shell Along
the Aisne.&#8221;</p>
